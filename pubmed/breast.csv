Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is acknowledged as an aggressive subtype of breast cancer. In this study, we found the lncRNA LINC00472 was poorly expressed in TNBC tissues and cells. Overexpression of LINC00472 could inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. On the contrary, minichromosome maintenance complex component 6 (MCM6) was highly expressed in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells due to suppressed methylation. LINC00472 induced site-specific DNA methylation and reduced the MCM6 expression by recruiting DNA methyltransferases into the MCM6 promoter. Since the restoration of MCM6 weakened the tumor-suppressive effect of LINC00472 on MDA-MB-231 cells, LINC00472 potentially acted as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting MCM6. In addition, in vivo experiments further substantiated that overexpression of LINC00472 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis to lungs by decreasing the expression of MCM6. Overall, the present study demonstrated that LINC00472-mediated epigenetic silencing of MCM6 contributes to the prevention of tumorigenesis and metastasis in TNBC, providing an exquisite therapeutic target for TNBC."

However, most studies focused on CRF during or shortly after treatment. Longitudinal studies are rare with inconsistent results. We assessed the association of inflammatory biomarkers with total CRF and all subdomains (physical, cognitive, affective) in long-term breast cancer survivors. METHOD: Patients recruited between 2002 and 2005 provided information on CRF at first follow-up (FU1) (N = 1292) and second follow-up (FU2) (N = 1205), after a median of 6.2 years and 11.7 years, respectively. Associations of 11 inflammatory biomarkers with CRF at FU1 and at FU2 were assessed using linear regression models. Logistic regression models were used to compare patients fatigued at both time-points and those never fatigued (N = 932). RESULTS: C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly associated with total CRF at FU1 (beta = 1.47, 95%CI = 0.62-2.31, p = 0.0007), at FU2 (beta = 1.98, 95 %CI = 0.96-2.99, p = 0.0001) and with persistent CRF (OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.13-1.47, p < 0.0001). IL-6 levels were associated with total CRF at FU1 (beta = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.43-1.59, p = 0.0006), but not with CRF at FU2 or persistent CRF. No association remained significant after adjustment for relevant covariates. DISCUSSION: CRP and Il-6 were associated with risk of CRF in long-term breast cancer survivors, but were not independent of other known risk factors, suggesting that currently studied inflammatory markers are not suitable to identify patients at risk of long-term CRF."

The improvement of microvascular function is critical for cardiac repair after MI. Evidence now points to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as key regulators of cardiac remodelling processes. The lncRNA Malat1 is involved in the development and progression of multiple cardiac diseases. Studies have shown that Malat1 is closely related to the regulation of endothelial cell regeneration. However, the potential molecular mechanisms of Malat1 in repairing cardiac microvascular dysfunction after MI remain unreported. METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study found that Malat1 is upregulated in the border zone of infarction in mouse hearts, as well as in isolated cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs). Targeted knockdown of Malat1 in endothelial cells exacerbated oxidative stress, attenuated angiogenesis and microvascular perfusion, and as a result decreased cardiac function in MI mice. Further studies showed that silencing Malat1 obviously inhibited CMEC proliferation, migration and tube formation, which was at least in part attributed to disturbed mitochondrial dynamics and activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Moreover, bioinformatic analyses, luciferase assays and pull-down assays indicated that Malat1 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-26b-5p and formed a signalling axis with Mfn1 to regulate mitochondrial dynamics and endothelial functions. Overexpression of Mfn1 markedly reversed the microvascular dysfunction and CMEC injuries that were aggravated by silencing Malat1 via inhibition of excessive mitochondrial fragments and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The present study elucidated the functions and mechanisms of Malat1 in cardiac microcirculation repair after MI. The underlying mechanisms of the effects of Malat1 could be attributed to its blocking effects on miR-26b-5p/Mfn1 pathway-mediated mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis."

CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old male presented to the breast clinic with an abscess and was later diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer. He presented with an abscess and was initially treated with antibiotics. Imaging showed a large left breast mass consistent with inflammatory carcinoma with axillary lymph node involvement. Patient was started on Tamoxifen as a bridge for surgery with no response. He eventually had a mastectomy and axillary clearance with the histology confirming the diagnosis and tumour emboli in the lymphatic vessels. Chemotherapy, radiation and dual hormone therapy were included in the adjuvant treatment plan. Two episodes of neutropenic sepsis led to completing only five out of six planned chemotherapy cycles. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: A review of literature and the reported cases was done by the team to contribute to the little information published about the disease and its management. The presented to the breast clinic during the height of the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic. The global impact of SARS-CoV-19 made surgical teams find ways to lessen elective lists to give way for patients affected during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Very few cases of inflammatory breast cancer have been reported in men. The diagnosis can be missed leading to delay in management. Management can be challenging and complex."

In TNBC cells, high PD-L1 expression can induce an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, repressing the anti-tumoral immune responses. Although FDA-approved agents targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis are potent to eliminate tumoral cells, their immune-related adverse events have become worrisome. As the regulator of gene expression, siRNAs can directly target PD-L1 in breast cancer cells. The gene modification of tumoral PD-L1 can reduce our reliance on the current method of targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 axis. We initiated the study with bioinformatics analysis; the results indicated that TNBC and the MDA-MB-231 cells significantly overexpressed PD-L1 compared to other breast cancer subtypes and cell lines. Our results demonstrated that PD-L1 silencing substantially reduced PD-L1 expression at mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, our results demonstrated that PD-L1 knockdown reduced cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis via intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. We observed that PD-L1 silencing effectively inhibited the migration of TNBC cells. Further investigation also displayed that silencing of PD-L1 in breast cancer cells induced T-cell cytotoxic function by upregulating the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha, and downregulating the gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-10, and TGF-beta, in a co-culture system."

The results indicated that tumor cell transfection with siRNA-encapsulated NPs robustly inhibited proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis in tumor cells. Furthermore, simultaneous silencing of HIF-1alpha and STAT3 significantly repressed cancer development in two different tumor types (4T1 breast cancer and CT26 colon cancer) which was associated with upregulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and IFN-gamma secretion.

Heparanase-mediated degradation of heparan sulfate (HS) is the critical process for tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, therefore, heparanase become an attractive target for cancer research. Herein, we reported a native fucosylated glycosaminoglycan (nHG) extracted from sea cucumber Holothuria fuscopunctata and a depolymerized nHG (dHG) and its contained oligosaccharides (hs17, hs14, hs11, hs8 and hs5), acting as heparanase inhibitors. nHG and its derivatives have the ability to bind with heparanase directly, leading to significant inhibition of heparanase activity. Moreover, their apparent binding affinity to heparanase was comparable to their inhibitory effect, which was elevated along with the increase of chain length, similar to the effect of heparins. In addition, oligosaccharides inhibited the migration and invasion of 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and also suppressed tube formation in Matrigel matrix and angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. In the metastatic mouse model, oligosaccharides exhibited practical antimetastatic effects on 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells. According to the reported anticoagulant activity and the low bleeding tendency of dHG and its oligosaccharides, the use of the oligosaccharides may lead to better effects on tumor patients with thrombosis tendency."

In oncology, pruritus-associated cutaneous adverse events (paCAEs) are frequent with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) and targeted anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapies. Thus, we sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IgE blockade with omalizumab in cancer patients with refractory paCAEs related to CPIs and anti-HER2 agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients included in this multicenter retrospective analysis received monthly subcutaneous injections of omalizumab for CPI or anti-HER2 therapy-related grade 2/3 pruritus that was refractory to topical corticosteroids plus at least one additional systemic intervention. To assess clinical response to omalizumab, we used the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. The primary endpoint was defined as reduction in the severity of paCAEs to grade 1/0. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients (50% female, 68 years median age) received omalizumab for cancer therapy-related paCAEs (71% CPIs; 29% anti-HER2). All had solid tumors (29% breast, 29% genitourinary, 15% lung, 26% other), and most (18, 64%) presented with an urticarial phenotype. Twenty-eight of 34 (82%) patients responded to omalizumab. The proportion of patients receiving oral corticosteroids as supportive treatment for management of paCAEs decreased with IgE blockade, from 50% to 9% (p < 0.001). Ten of 32 (31%) patients had interruption of oncologic therapy due to skin toxicity; four of six (67%) were successfully rechallenged following omalizumab. There were no reports of anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reactions related to omalizumab. CONCLUSIONS: IgE blockade with omalizumab demonstrated clinical efficacy and was well tolerated in cancer patients with pruritus related to CPIs and anti-HER2 therapies."

In order to reduce the side-effects of mitoxantrone (MTO), estrone-targeted liposomes for MTO delivery via ER were designed for selectively targeting cancer cells. In previous studies, MTO-loaded estrogen receptor targeted and sterically stabilized liposome (ES-SSL-MTO; ES: estrone, is known to bind the ER) had been synthesized and showed a very high antiproliferative effect with IC50 value of 0.7 ng/mL. Based on these, further studies including in vivo targeting efficacy and antitumor activity, acute toxicity and pharmacokinetics of MTO liposomes were carried out. The results showed SSL (sterically stabilized liposome, PEGylated liposome, PEG: Polyethylene Glycol) could reduce drug metabolism, improve the stability of liposomes, prolong in vivo circulation time of drugs, reduce the toxicity of MTO. But SSL could not be enriched in tumor tissues. However, estrone (ES)-targeted liposomes could be delivered to tumor sites. ES-SSL could effectively enter into ER-expressing tumor cells and be accumulated, prolong the circulation time in vivo, reduce side effects of drug. ES-SSL-MTO could provide higher bioavailability than MTO, enhance the anti-tumor effect and the safety of MTO, reduce the toxicity and side effects of MTO and improve the therapeutic effect of MTO. These facts proved ES-SSL is a useful tumor-targeting drug delivery system for MTO."

Luminal B subtype, high proliferation, lack of progesterone receptor, high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are positively associated with increased pCR rates but worse outcomes and the prognostic role of pCR is inconsistent across studies. Molecular intrinsic subtyping and genomic signatures appear as more accurate predictors of benefit from NACT, but larger studies are needed. Anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy remains the standard NACT; however, CDK 4/6 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors are under evaluation.

METHODS: miR-646, TET1, IRX1, and HIST2H2BE expression was detected by RT-qPCR and/or Western blot analysis. The methylation status of IRX1 promoter region was evaluated by methylation specific PCR. ChIP assay was used to determine the enrichment of TET1 at IRX1 promoter region. Loss- and gain-of functions were performed to determine the roles of miR-646, TET1, IRX1, and HIST2H2BE in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. The tumor growth, volume, weight, and apoptosis status were measured. RESULTS: miR-646 was upregulated while TET1 was downregulated in IDC tissues. miR-646 targeted TET1. Downregulated TET1 impairs demethylation of IRX1 promoter region resulting in reduced expression of IRX1, which subsequently leads to upregulation of HIST2H2BE in IDC. Consequently, elevated HIST2H2BE promotes progression of IDC. CONCLUSION: Our study has demonstrated that miR-646 facilitates the tumorigenesis of IDC via regulating TET1/IRX1/HIST2H2BE axis."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the patients who underwent mastectomy between 2008 and 2016, we included 330 patients with secondary arm lymphedema. Percentage of excessive volume (PEV) of the arm were serially assessed using an optoelectronic volumetry 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months after the lymphedema diagnosis (Tlymh_Dx). We defined PSL as 2 or more episodes of PEV >/= 20%. Risk factors for PSL were evaluated using stepwise regression analyses. RESULTS: Patients who received PMRT (n=202, 61.2%) were more likely to have larger extent of axillary node dissection (AND), and frequent stage II/III lymphedema at Tlymh_Dx than those who did not receive PMRT (p<0.001). With a median follow-up of 72.5 months, PSL occurred in 71 (21.5%) patients. Patients with PSL were more frequently treated with AND of >/=20 nodes without reconstruction, had advanced lymphedema stage and higher PEV at Tlymh_Dx, and more frequent events of cellulitis compared to those without PSL. The risk of developing PSL was significantly associated with PMRT with regional node irradiation (RNI), AND of >/=20 nodes, lymphedema stage, and PEV at Tlymh_Dx, cellulitis, and compliance with physical therapy. CONCLUSION: PMRT, especially RNI, was associated with a consistent increase in PEV in patients with arm lymphedema. Therefore, timely physical therapy is necessary for this patient population."

Molecular cell research,"Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is an aggressive disease characterized by late clinical presentation, large tumor size, treatment resistance and low survival rate. Expression of EGFR/HER2 and activation of intracellular tyrosine kinase domains in LABC are associated with poor prognosis. Thus, target therapies such as the anti-receptor tyrosine kinases lapatinib drug have been more developed in the past decade. The response to lapatinib involves the inhibition of RTKs and subsequently signaling molecules such as Src/STAT3/Erk1/2 known also to be activated by the cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The aim of the present study is to identify the major cytokine that might contribute to lapatinib resistance in EGFR+/HER2+ LABC patients. Indeed, tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are the main source of cytokines in the TME. Herein, we isolated TAMs from LABC during modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Cytokine profile of TAMs revealed that IL-8 is the most prominent highly secreted cytokine by TAMs of LABC patients. Using in-vitro cell culture model we showed that recombinant IL-8 (50 and 100ng/mL) at different time intervals interfere with lapatinib action via activation of Src/EGFR and signaling molecules known to be inhibited during treatment. We proposed that to improve LABC patients' response to lapatinib treatment it is preferred to use combined therapy that neutralize or block the action of IL-8."

Although these attributes are associated with aging-related autoimmunity, their direct contributions remain unclear.

Here, we found KU complex abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm, where it recognized accumulated cytoplasmic DNA in aged human and mouse CD4(+) T cells. This process enhanced T cell activation and pathology of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in aged mice. Mechanistically, KU-mediated DNA sensing facilitated DNA-PKcs recruitment and phosphorylation of the kinase ZAK. This activated AKT and mTOR pathways, promoting CD4(+) T cell proliferation and activation. We developed a specific ZAK inhibitor, which dampened EAE pathology in aged mice.

This co-morbidity is associated with a negative prognosis in terms of increased morbidity and mortality rates, increased healthcare costs, decreased adherence to treatment regimens, and a substantial decline in quality of life. Therefore, preventing the onset of depressive episodes in adults with long-term physical conditions should be a global healthcare aim. In this review, primary or tertiary (in cases of preventing recurrences in those with a history of depression) prevention are the focus. While primary prevention aims at preventing the onset of depression, tertiary prevention comprises both preventing recurrences and prohibiting relapses. Tertiary prevention aims to address a depressive episode that might still be present, is about to subside, or has recently resolved. We included tertiary prevention in the case where the focus was preventing the onset of depression in those with a history of depression (preventing recurrences) but excluded it if it specifically focused on maintaining an condition or implementing rehabilitation services (relapse prevention). Secondary prevention of depression seeks to prevent the progression of depressive symptoms by early detection and treatment and may therefore be considered a 'treatment,' rather than prevention. We therefore exclude the whole spectrum of secondary prevention. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of psychological or pharmacological interventions, in comparison to control conditions, in preventing depression in adults with long-term physical conditions; either before first ever onset of depressive symptoms (i.e. primary prevention) or before first onset of depressive symptoms in patients with a history of depression (i.e. tertiary prevention). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registries, up to 6 February 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive psychological or pharmacological interventions, specifically targeting incidence of depression in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), waiting list, attention/psychological placebo, or placebo. Participants had to be age 18 years or older, with at least one long-term physical condition, and no diagnosis of major depression at baseline (primary prevention). In addition, we included studies comprising mixed samples of patients with and without a history of depression, which explored tertiary prevention of recurrent depression. We excluded other tertiary prevention studies. We also excluded secondary preventive interventions. Primary outcomes included incidence of depression, tolerability, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included severity of depression, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs, with one trial on psychological interventions, and 10 trials on pharmacological interventions. Data analyses on the psychological intervention (problem-solving therapy compared to TAU) included 194 participants with age-related macular degeneration. Data analyses on pharmacological interventions included 837 participants comparing citalopram (one trial), escitalopram (three trials), a mixed sample of fluoxetine/nortriptyline (one trial), melatonin (one trial), milnacipran (one trial), and sertraline (three trials), each to placebo. Included types of long-term physical conditions were acute coronary syndrome (one trial), breast cancer (one trial), head and neck cancer (two trials), stroke (five trials), and traumatic brain injury (one trial). Psychological interventions Very low-certainty evidence of one study suggests that problem solving therapy may be slightly more effective than TAU in preventing the incidence of depression, immediately post-intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.95; 194 participants). However, there may be little to no difference between groups at six months follow-up (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.38; 190 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available regarding incidence of depression after six months. Regarding acceptability (drop-outs due to any cause), slightly fewer drop-outs occurred in the TAU group immediately post-intervention (OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 24.40; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). After six months, however, the groups did not differ (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.77; 206 participants; low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure tolerability. Pharmacological interventions Post-intervention, compared to placebo, antidepressants may be beneficial in preventing depression in adults with different types of long-term physical conditions, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.49; 814 participants; nine studies; I(2) =0%; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups both immediately and at six months follow-up (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.46; 23 participants; one study; very low-certainty evidence) as well as at six to 12 months follow-up (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.82; 233 participants; three studies; I(2) = 49%; very low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from five studies regarding the tolerability of the pharmacological intervention. A total of 669 adverse events were observed in 316 participants from the pharmacological intervention group, and 610 adverse events from 311 participants in the placebo group. There was very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to adverse events may be less frequent in the placebo group (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.89; 561 participants; five studies; I(2) = 0%). There was also very low-certainty evidence that drop-outs due to any cause may not differ between groups either post-intervention (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.73; 962 participants; nine studies; I(2) = 28%), or at six to 12 months (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.86; 327 participants; three studies; I(2) = 0%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on evidence of very low certainty, our results may indicate the benefit of pharmacological interventions, during or directly after preventive treatment. Few trials examined short-term outcomes up to six months, nor the follow-up effects at six to 12 months, with studies suffering from great numbers of drop-outs and inconclusive results. Generalisation of results is limited as study populations and treatment regimes were very heterogeneous. Based on the results of this review, we conclude that for adults with long-term physical conditions, there is only very uncertain evidence regarding the implementation of any primary preventive interventions (psychological/pharmacological) for depression."

Thirty-three animals were used to measure the loin eye area by ultrasound in vivo (LEAu) and in the carcass. We used 39 animals for biometric measurement in vivo and 42 sheep for morphometric measurement in the carcass. For the physical and chemical compositions of carcasses, dissection of the half left carcass was carried out in 42 animals. The data were submitted to Pearson's correlation analysis and t test. Simple and multiple linear regressions were performed using a stepwise procedure. All correlations between in vivo measurements and the physical and chemical compositions of carcasses (in kg) were significant, except for LEAu. Biometric measurements and hot (HCW) and cold (CCW) carcass weights were considered as predictors of the carcasses' physical and chemical compositions. Slaughter body weight (SBW) was the variable that most influenced the equations in the assessment of in vivo measurements and HCW and CCW most influenced the equations for measurements on carcasses. Biometric measurements of Santa Ines sheep can be used together with the SBW to estimate the physical and chemical compositions of carcasses, with emphasis on body compactness index, breast width, wither height, and croup height. The morphometric measurements can be used together with carcass weight to estimate the physical and chemical compositions of carcasses, with emphasis on croup width, carcass compactness index, croup perimeter, external and internal carcass lengths, chest width, and leg length and perimeter.

We aimed to evaluate the changes in hormone (estrogen and progesterone) receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status post-NAC and their correlation with survival. METHODS: Patients with LABC who have received NAC between 2008 and 2015 and have been followed up till December 2019 at the Oncology Center, King Saud University, KSA were analyzed retrospectively. biomarker analysis of ER, PR & HER2 were done using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescent in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. HR status changed in 21(23.1%) patients, with a significant difference between patients with stable receptors and those with any receptor conversion; p = 0.000. Five (5.5%) initially HER2 negative tumors became HER2 positive and 10 (11%) initially HER2 positive tumors became HER2 negative after NAC. The difference in HER2 expression level before and after NAC was not statistically significant (p = 0.302). Univariate analysis relating patients' characteristics and 10-years disease-free survival (DFS) showed only significant correlations with the expressions of ER, PR, and any receptor conversion, (ER and/or PR) p< 0.001, p< 0.001, and p = 0.001; respectively. In the univariate analysis, none of the clinicopathological features showed a significant correlation with the OS except for the molecular subtypes P<0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LABC have significant changes in the ER and PR receptor status following NAC. Post-NAC expressions change of ER and PR (ER and/or PR) are correlated to DFS.

The existing methods for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) rely mainly on time-course gene expression data. However, most available omics data from cross-sectional studies of cancer patients often lack sufficient temporal information, leading to a key challenge for GRN inference. Through quantifying the latent progression using random walks-based manifold distance, we propose a latent-temporal progression-based Bayesian method, PROB, for inferring GRNs from the cross-sectional transcriptomic data of tumor samples. The robustness of PROB to the measurement variabilities in the data is mathematically proved and numerically verified. Performance evaluation on real data indicates that PROB outperforms other methods in both pseudotime inference and GRN inference. Applications to bladder cancer and breast cancer demonstrate that our method is effective to identify key regulators of cancer progression or drug targets. The identified ACSS1 is experimentally validated to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of bladder cancer cells, and the predicted FOXM1-targets interactions are verified and are predictive of relapse in breast cancer. Our study suggests new effective ways to clinical transcriptomic data modeling for characterizing cancer progression and facilitates the translation of regulatory network-based approaches into precision medicine."

High mammographic breast density is a well-established breast cancer risk factor that also increases the risk of death. However, there is limited data of breast density patterns among Mexican women and their association with breast cancer incidence and mortality. Objective: To determine the distribution of breast density patterns and BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) among women from Torreon, Coahuila. Method: Observational and retrospective study. Mammographic reports of women from Torreon, Mexico, were analyzed. Reports came from IMSS HGZ#16, Sanatorio Espanol and a private radiological office. Only mammographic records which described age, breast density and Bi-RADS reports were included. Differences on breast density distribution were analyzed with the Chi-Square test according to age, economic sectors and BI-RADS classification. Results: A total of 2,187 women were included, representing about 1% of the total adult women population of Torreon. The mean age was 54.4 years, and the mammographic density patterns distribution was: 19.15% fatty, 47.76% fibroglandular density, 27.10% heterogeneously dense, and 5.99% extremely dense. Conclusions: The main pattern in this Mexican population is the fibroglandular density, and extremely dense breast was only 6%. Our results suggest that non-dense breast tissue could increase breast cancer risk. Further studies on related risk factors, like body mass index are required."

METHODS: The SF-6Dv2 and FACT-B instruments were completed for 416 patients who were recruited from the largest academic center for cancer patients in Iran. The ceiling effects are computed as the proportion of participants reporting no problems in SF-6Dv2 index. Construct validity was evaluated using convergent validity, discriminant validity, and known-groups validity. Reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohen's kappa value. RESULTS: The ceiling effects of the SF-6Dv2 was 2.16%. Higher scores of all subscales of the FACT-B were associated with patients who reported no problems in each of the SF-6Dv2 dimensions. The correlation between SF-6Dv2 dimensions and FACT-B subscales varied from 0.109 between the role limitation of the SF-6Dv2 and the SWB subscale of the FACT-B to 0.665 between the pain dimension of SF-6Dv2 and the PWB of FACT-B. The lower mean score of SF-6Dv2 was associated with patients with older age, higher education level, more severe current treatment status, and more severe cancer stage status. ICC for the SF-6Dv2 index scores was 0.66, and Kappa values varied from 0.33 for mobility to 0.66 for mental health dimensions.

To understand current patterns of screening mammography use and breast cancer diagnoses among older women, we examined recent national data on mammography screening use and breast cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis among women aged >/= 65 years. METHODS: We examined breast cancer incidence using the 2016 United States Cancer Statistics dataset and analyzed screening mammography use among women aged >/= 65 years using the 2018 National Health Interview Survey. RESULTS: Women aged 70-74 years had the highest breast cancer incidence rate (458.3 cases per 100,000 women), and women aged >/= 85 years had the lowest rate (295.2 per 100,000 women). The proportion of cancer diagnosed at distant stage or with unknown stage increased with age. Over half of women aged 80-84 years and 26.0% of women aged >/= 85 years reported a screening mammogram within the last 2 years. Excellent/very good/good self-reported health status (p = .010) and no dependency in activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living (p < .001) were associated with recent mammography screening.

The optimal management of NCBs revealing RSLs is controversial, and understanding of the natural history of unresected RSLs is limited. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed pathology and imaging data from 148 patients with NCB revealing RSL without atypia from 2015 to 2019 to determine the prevalence of malignancy and the behavior of RSLs undergoing active surveillance (AS). RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 52 years, and most lesions were screen-detected (91%). The median lesion size was 6.0 mm (range 2-39). Most patients (66%, n = 98) underwent immediate surgery, while 34% (n = 50) of patients underwent AS, with a median follow-up of 16 months (range 6-51). Of the excised RSLs, 99% (n = 97) were benign and 1% (n = 1) revealed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In 17% (n = 17) of cases, additional high-risk lesions were discovered upon excision. Among the 50 patients undergoing AS, no lesions progressed on interval imaging. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, 99% of RSLs undergoing excision were benign, 1% revealed DCIS, and there were no invasive cancers. In the first study of patients with RSLs undergoing AS, we found that all lesions either remained stable or resolved. We propose that the vast majority of patients with RSL on NCB can be safely offered AS, and that routine excision is a low-value intervention."

The 125I-MT NPs exhibited high labeling efficiency (98 +/- 2%) with a hydrodynamic diameter of 91.3 +/- 5.5 nm. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that 125I-MT NPs emitted intensive NIR-II fluorescence and SPECT signals, and possessed good biocompatibility. By using a breast tumor xenograft mouse model after intravenous injection of 125I-MT NPs, the SPECT imaging and NIR-II imaging showed clear images of tumor tissues at 8 h and 48 h postinjection, respectively, suggesting the feasibility of using 125I-MT NPs to detect tumors before surgery and visualize the dissection area during surgery. In addition, the SPECT scan of a lymph node mapping was performed at 1 h postinjection and NIR-II fluorescence imaging was carried out at 4 h postinjection. This further guarantees the accurate imaging of lymph nodes before and during surgery for lymphadenectomy.

Case Report: A 28-year-old woman diagnosed with bipolar II disorder received brotizolam during pregnancy (28-40 weeks' gestational age) and lactation, along with sertraline, alprazolam, and trazodone. A male infant weighing 3,412 g was born at 40 weeks of gestation. Neonatal abstinence syndrome manifested as fever, limb tremor, and central cyanosis, requiring oxygenation and intravenous phenobarbital administration for 4 days.

However, label-free SERS bioanalysis faces challenges in reliability and reproducibility due to SERS signals' high susceptibility to local optical field variations at plasmonic hotspots, which can bias correlations between the measured spectroscopic features and the actual molecular concentration profiles of complex biochemical matrices. Herein, we report that plasmonically enhanced electronic Raman scattering (ERS) signals from metal nanostructures can serve as a SERS calibration internal standard to improve multivariate analysis of living biological systems. Through side-by-side comparisons with noncalibrated SERS datasets, we demonstrate that the ERS-based SERS calibration can enhance supervised learning classification of label-free living cell SERS spectra in (1) subtyping breast cancer cells with different degrees of malignancy and (2) assessing cancer cells' drug responses at different dosages. Notably, the ERS-based SERS calibration has the advantages of excellent photostability under laser excitation, no spectral interference with biomolecule Raman signatures, and no occupation competition with biomolecules at hotspots. Therefore, we envision that the ERS-based SERS calibration can significantly boost the multivariate analysis performance in label-free SERS measurements of living biological systems and other complex biochemical matrices."

This has greatly accelerated research into human health and has facilitated the discovery of novel therapeutics. CRISPR-Cas9 is most widely employed for its ability to inactivate or knockout specific genes, but can be also used to introduce subtle site-specific substitutions of DNA sequences that can lead to changes in the amino acid composition of proteins. Despite the proven success of CRISPR-based knockin strategies of genes in typical diploid cells (i.e. cells containing two sets of chromosomes), precise editing of cancer cells, that typically have unstable genomes and multiple copies of chromosomes, is more challenging and not adequately addressed in the literature. Herein, we detail our methodology for replacing endogenous proteins with intended knockin mutants in polyploid cancer cells and discuss our experimental design, screening strategy, and facile allele-frequency estimation methodology. As proof of principle, we performed genome editing of specific amino acids within the pioneer transcription factor FOXA1, a critical component of estrogen and androgen receptor signaling, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We confirm mutant FOXA1 protein expression and intended amino acids substitutions via western blotting and mass spectrometry. In addition, we show that mutant allele-frequency estimation is easily achieved by TOPO cloning combined with allele-specific PCR, which we later confirmed by next-generation RNA-sequencing. Typically, there are 4 - 5 copies (alleles) of FOXA1 in breast cancer cells, making the editing of this protein inherently challenging. As a result, most studies that focus on FOXA1 mutants rely on ectopic overexpression of FOXA1 from a plasmid. Therefore, we provide an optimized methodology for replacing endogenous wildtype FOXA1 with precise knockin mutants to enable the systematic analysis of its molecular mechanisms within the appropriate physiological context."

In this review, we present a current overview of the three-dimensional structures of bifidobacterial proteins involved in carbohydrate uptake, degradation, and metabolism. As predominant early colonizers of the infant's gut, distinct bifidobacterial species are equipped with a panel of transporters and enzymes specific for human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Interestingly, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium longum possess lacto-N-biosidases with unrelated structural folds to release the disaccharide lacto-N-biose from HMOs, suggesting the convergent evolution of this activity from different ancestral proteins. The crystal structures of enzymes that confer the degradation of glycans from the mucin glycoprotein layer provide a structural basis for the utilization of this sustainable nutrient in the gastrointestinal tract. The utilization of several plant dietary oligosaccharides has been studied in detail, and the prime importance of oligosaccharide-specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in glycan utilisations by bifidobacteria has been revealed. The structural elements underpinning the high selectivity and roles of ABC transporter binding proteins in establishing competitive growth on preferred oligosaccharides are discussed. Distinct ABC transporters are conserved across several bifidobacterial species, e.g. those targeting arabinoxylooligosaccharide and alpha-1,6-galactosides/glucosides. Less prevalent transporters, e.g. targeting beta-mannooligosaccharides, may contribute to the metabolic specialisation within Bifidobacterium. Some bifidobacterial species have established symbiotic relationships with humans. Structural studies of carbohydrate-utilizing systems in Bifidobacterium have revealed the interesting history of molecular coevolution with the host, as highlighted by the early selection of bifidobacteria by mucin and breast milk glycans."

Among nonadherent women, 18.0% reported never having a mammography. Never screened women were significantly younger than previously screened women (adjusted prevalence odds ratio [aPOR] = 7.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.38, 22.50]) and almost four times as likely to have the governmental health plan (GHP; aPOR = 3.78, 95% CI: [1.15, 12.46]).

Results from this study can be used to target never screened women with health education messages addressing perceived cons of mammography. Additionally, women with GHP insurance may experience disparities in health care access and should be targeted with policies that facilitate access to mammography screening."

Most trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell lines available from biobanks feature either phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha (PIK3CA) mutation or the loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). However, PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss do not account for most trastuzumab-resistant tumors in humans. METHODS: Breast cancer cells were collected from one patient's malignant ascites. These cells were cultured and maintained to develop a stable cell line, which we named CK-MB-1. We used western blotting to evaluate protein expression. The PIK3CA status of CK-MB-1 cells was analyzed using Sanger sequencing and validated using next-generation sequencing. In vivo, CK-MB-1 xenograft tumor models were developed in zebrafish and immunodeficient mice. RESULTS: CK-MB-1 cells maintained the major characteristics of the parental tumor including HER2 positivity and estrogen receptor negativity. The HER2 gene amplification of CK-MB-1 cells was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The integrity of PTEN was confirmed by its positive protein expression and the absence of gene mutations. No common PIK3CA mutation was detected. Compared with the findings in two other HER2-positive trastuzumab-resistant cell lines, CK-MB-1 cells exhibited greater resistance to trastuzumab, chemotherapeutics, and small-molecule drugs. Trastuzumab resistance in CK-MB-1 cells was confirmed in vivo using the NOD SCID mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: CK-MB-1 cells represent a stable HER2-positive trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell line. The resistance of CK-MB-1 cells does not originate from the PTEN or phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway, which can provide an alternative approach for potential drugs."

We described the activity and the care organisation of the Hospitalisation At Home (HAH) structure during the pandemic for treating patients with anti-cancer injections. METHODS: We report the established organisation, the eligibility criteria, the patient characteristics, the treatment schemes and the stakeholders' role during two 5-week periods in 2020, before and during the French population's lockdown. RESULTS: The increase of activity during the lockdown (+32% of treated patients, +156% of new patients and +28% of delivered preparations) concerned solid tumour, mainly breast cancer, even if haematological malignancies remained the most frequent. Thirty different drugs were delivered, including three new drugs administered in HAH versus 19 during the routine period (p < 0.01). For those clinical departments accustomed to using HAH, the usual organisation was kept, but with adjustments. Five clinical departments increased the number of patients treated at home and widened the panel of drugs prescribed. Three oncology departments and one radiotherapy department for the first time solicited HAH for anti-cancer injections, mainly for immunotherapy. We adjusted the HAH organisation with additional human resources and allowed to prescribe drugs with an infusion time of <30 min only for the new prescribers. CONCLUSION: HAH allowed for the continuation of anti-cancer injections without postponement during the pandemic, and for a decrease in unnecessary patient travel to hospital with its concomitant COVID-19 transmission risk. Often left out of guidelines, the place of HAH in treating cancer patients should be reappraised, even more so during a pandemic."

METHODS: A total of 10 radiologists read a curated, anonymized group of 299 breast ultrasound images that contained at least one suspicious lesion and for which a final diagnosis was independently determined. Separately, the AI program was initialized by a lead radiologist and the computed results compared against those of the radiologists. RESULTS: The AI program's diagnoses of breast lesions had concordance with the 10 radiologists' readings across a number of BI-RADS descriptors. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the AI program's diagnosis of benign versus malignant was above 0.8, in agreement with the highest performing radiologists and commensurate with recent studies. CONCLUSION: The trained AI program can contribute to accuracy of breast cancer diagnoses with ultrasound."

We found that stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) is overexpressed in BC tissues compared to non-tumorous breast tissues. Our study is to validate the prognostic value of STIP1 and investigate its biological role in BC. We verified the upregulation of STIP1 in multiple databases, proved that STIP1 is upregulated in BC tissues and cell lines using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). We used small interfering RNA to examine the function of STIP1 in BC cell lines (BT-549, MDA-MB-231, Hs-578 T) and explored the mechanism of function of STIP1 in BC cells using Western blotting and qRT-PCR. Analyses of multiple databases indicated that high STIP1 expression is a marker that effectively distinguishes BC patients from healthy control and predicts worse clinical outcomes in BC. The loss-of-function experiments showed that STIP1 silencing results in inhibition of cell proliferation and migration, inducing cell apoptosis, and S-phase arrest in vitro. Our study also showed that STIP1 downregulation inhibited the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Rescue experiments demonstrated that the oncogenic effect of STIP1 is partially dependent on mediating JAK2 expression. This study verified that STIP1 is an oncogenic gene that promotes BC progression and serves as a valuable diagnostic and outcome-related marker of BC."
