In this study, we investigated the effects of Plasmodium infection on the tumor inhibition and antitumor CD8(+) T cell responses in a murine triple negative breast cancer (TNBCA) model. The results showed that Plasmodium infection significantly inhibited tumor growth, and increased the survival rate of the tumor-bearing mice. Both effector and memory CD8(+) T cells were increased in peripheral blood and tumor-draining lymph node (DLN) in the infected mice. The co-stimulatory (CD40L, GITR and OX-40) and co-inhibitory (PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG3) immune checkpoints were up-regulated on CD8(+) T cells in infected mice. Importantly, Py induced remarkable effects on the infiltration of CD8(+) T cells in the tumor and granzym B(+) CD8(+) T cells in tumor-bearing mice while not in tumor-free mice. In summary, the results suggested that the effects of Plasmodium infection on murine 4T1 breast cancer might be related to the induction of CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor immune responses. This finding may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer."

Increasing evidence shows that GGCT has oncogenic functions and is overexpressed in various cancer tissues, and that inhibition of GGCT activity exerts anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that U83836E ((2R)-2-[[4-(2,6-dipyrrolidin-1-ylpyrimidin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl]methyl]-3,4-dihyd ro-2,5,7,8,-tetramethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-ol, dihydrochloride), a lazaroid that inhibits lipid peroxidation, inhibits GGCT enzymatic activity. U83836E was identified from a high-throughput screen of low molecular weight compounds using a fluorochrome-conjugated GGCT probe. We directly quantified that U83836E specifically inhibited GGCT by measuring the product of a fluorochrome-conjugated GGCT substrate assay, and showed that U83836E inhibited GGCT activity in extracts of NIH3T3 cells overexpressing GGCT. Moreover, U83836E significantly inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft model that used immunodeficient mice orthotopically inoculated with MCF7 human breast cancer cells. These results indicate that U83836E may be a useful GGCT inhibitor for the development of potential cancer therapeutics."

The proportion is also substantial in advanced lung cancer (20% - 40%). Because of the high prevalence of cancers of the breast, prostate and lung, these cancers account for more than 80% of cases of metastatic bone disease occurring in solid tumours. Metastatic bone disease is associated with greatly increased bone resorption by osteoclasts, leading to moderate to severe pain and other skeletal complications, with major impact on quality of life (QoL). Skeletal Related Events (SREs) have been defined as: pathological long bone or vertebral fractures; spinal cord compression; need for radiation for pain relief or to prevent fracture/spinal cord compression, need for surgery to bone and hypercalcaemia. More recently, Symptomatic Skeletal Events (SSEs) have been defined to monitor QoL. Although there are currently no curative treatments for metastatic bone disease, patients with breast or prostate cancer and BM are now surviving for several years and sometimes longer, and prevention of SREs is the key aim to optimization of QoL. Since their discovery 50years ago and their introduction more than 30years ago into the field of metastatic bone disease, a range of oral and intravenous bisphosphonate drugs have made a major contribution to prevention of SREs. Large trials have clearly demonstrated the clinical value of different bisphosphonate-based drugs (including the oral drugs ibandronate and clodronate and intravenous agents such as zoledronate and pamidronate), in treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy and the reduction of SREs and SSEs in a range of cancers. Despite the success of denosumab in reducing osteolysis, bisphosphonates also remain mainstay drugs for treatment of metastatic bone disease. Recognizing the 50th Anniversary of the discovery of bisphosphonates, this review focuses on their continuing value in BM treatment and their future potential, for example in providing a bone-targeting vehicle for cytotoxic drugs."

Firstly, our bioinformatics analysis suggested miR-1226-3p as a bona fide regulator of HER2, PIK3R2, and AKT1 putative target genes. Secondly, RT-qPCR, ELISA test and western blotting showed that overexpression of miR-1226 was followed by reduced expression of HER2, PIK3R2, and AKT1 putative targets genes in SKBR3 cells. Third, dual luciferase assay verified direct interaction of miR-1226-3p with 3'UTR sequences of these target genes. Then, overexpression of miR-1226 in SKBR3 cells brought about increased population of sub-G1 and decreased populations of G1 cells, measured by flow cytometry. This was consistent to the reduction of p-AKT protein and increased BAX protein levels, detected by western analysis and consistent to decreased CCND1 genes expression, detected by RT-qPCR. The reduced survival and increased apoptosis rate of these cells was also verified through MTT, Annexin V-FITC and Live-Dead cell staining assays. Our results suggest that miR-1226-3p is a tumor suppressor in SKBR3 cells. However, following the overexpression of miR-1226 in MDA-MB-231 cells, Bax/Bcl2 ratio and CCND1 genes expression levels were not significantly changed, sub-G1 and G1 cell cycle population were reduced while, S and G2/M cell populations were increased, consistent to the results acquired from the apoptosis and staining assays. Finally, TCGA data analysis and RT-qPCR against 20 pairs of Normal/Tumor breast tissues indicated that miR-1226-3p has been downregulated in breast cancer. Overall, the present study gathered shreds of evidence that suggest miR-1226-3p as a tumor suppressor that exerts its inhibitory effect on SKBR3 cells through targeting of HER2, PIK3R2, and AKT1 genes and downregulates PI3K/AKT pathway."

Then all groups were subjected to RT-qPCR using Gene expression specific primers. Also, western blot protein expression and molecular docking were done. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test was employed to test the significance using GraphPad Prism. RESULTS: The IC50 values were 3.36mug/ml and 3.60mug/ml for 2-HBTSc and 4-HBTSc treated MCF-7 tumor cells respectively. Tumor cell growth inhibition ranged from 38 to 49.27% in 4-HBTSc treated cells, and 19 to 25% in 2-HBTSc treated cells with increase in doses 5mug/ml to 20mug/ml. The protein and gene expression result showed a significant upregulation in tumor suppressor and apoptosis inducing genes while, oncogene activity was significantly downregulated. Specifically, BRCA2 and pRB gene showed the highest expression in 4-HBTSc and 2-HBTSc treated cells respectively. Conversely, RAS oncogene was downregulated significantly. Docking result showed that both 2-HBTSc and 4-HBTSc have the potential to inhibit Estrogen Receptor Alpha Ligand Binding Domain, Human 17-Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 mutant protein and Human Topoisomerase II alpha that are expressed more during Breast Cancer.

UDG depletion sensitizes cells to high APOBEC3B deaminase and to pemetrexed (PEM) and floxuridine (5-FdU), which are toxic to tumor cells through incorporation of uracil and 5-FU into DNA. To identify small-molecule UDG inhibitors for pre-clinical evaluation, we optimized biochemical screening of a selected diversity collection of >3,000 small-molecules. We found aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) as an inhibitor of purified UDG at an initial calculated IC50<100nM. Subsequent enzymatic assays confirmed effective ATA inhibition but with an IC50 of 700nM and showed direct binding to the human UDG with a KD of <700nM. ATA displays preferential, dose-dependent binding to purified human UDG compared to human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase. ATA did not bind uracil-containing DNA at these concentrations. Yet, combined crystal structure and in silico docking results unveil ATA interactions with the DNA binding channel and uracil-binding pocket in an open, destabilized UDG conformation. Biologically relevant ATA inhibition of UDG was measured in cell lysates from human DLD1 colon cancer cells and in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using a host cell reactivation assay. Collective findings provide proof-of-principle for development of an ATA-based chemotype and ""door stopper"" strategy targeting inhibitor binding to a destabilized, open pre-catalytic glycosylase conformation that prevents active site closing for functional DNA binding and nucleotide flipping needed to excise altered bases in DNA."

To migrate to distant sites, cancer cells would need to adapt their behaviour in response to different tissue environments. Thus, it is essential to study this process in models that can closely replicate the tumour microenvironment. Here, we evaluate the use of organotypic liver and brain slices to study cancer metastasis. Morphological and viability parameters of the slices were monitored daily over 3 days in culture to assess their stability as a realistic 3D tissue platform for in vitro metastatic assays. Using these slices, we evaluated the invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and of a subpopulation that was selected for increased motility. We show that the more aggressive invasion of the selected cells likely resulted not only from their lower stiffness, but also from their lower adhesion to the surrounding tissue. Different invasion patterns in the brain and liver slices were observed for both subpopulations. Cells migrated faster in the brain slices (with an amoeboid-like mode) compared to in the liver slices (where they migrated with mesenchymal or collective migration-like modes). Inhibition of the Ras/MAPK/ERK pathway increased cell stiffness and adhesion forces, which resulted in reduced invasiveness. These results illustrate the potential for organotypic tissue slices to more closely mimic in vivo conditions during cancer cell metastasis than most in vitro models."

These effects may be initiated during a prenatal period of susceptibility to PAH activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) and through downstream effects on estrogen receptor (Er) alpha. PURPOSE: We hypothesized prenatal airborne PAH exposure induces sustained effects in female adult wild type BALB/cByj mice detected in the offspring (F1) and grandoffspring (F2) generation. We hypothesized these effects would include altered expression and epigenetic regulation of Eralpha and altered expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (Ahrr, Ahrr/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt), and breast cancer type 1 susceptibility (Brca1). Further, we hypothesized that PAH would induce precancerous outcomes such as epithelial cell proliferation and epithelial cell hyperplasia in mammary glands of adult female offspring and grandoffspring. RESULTS: Prenatal ambient PAH exposure lowered Eralpha mRNA expression (F1 and F2: p<0.001 for each) and induced methylation in the Eralpha promoter in mammary tissue in offspring and grandoffspring mice on postnatal day (PND) 60. Prenatal PAH lowered Brca1 mRNA (F1: p=0.002, F2: p=0.02); Eralpha mRNA was correlated with Brca1 (F1: r=0.42, p=0.02; F2: r=0.53, p=0.005). Prenatal PAH lowered Ahrr (F1: p=0.03, F2: p=0.009) and raised Arnt mRNA expression (F1: p=0.01, F2: p=0.03). Alterations in Eralpha mRNA (F2: p<0.0001) and Ahrr (F2: p=0.02) in the grandoffspring mice also occured by PND 28, and similarly occurred in the dam on postpartum day (PPD) 28. Finally, prenatal PAH was associated with higher mammary epithelial cell proliferation in the offspring (p=0.02), but not grandoffspring mice, without differences in the frequency of mammary cell hyperplasia. These results did not differ after adjustment by each candidate gene expression level. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal PAH exposure induces DNA methylation and alters gene expression in the Eralpha-mediated pathway across generations, and suggests that functional outcomes such as mammary cell proliferation also may occur in offspring as a result."

Grisotti flap is a breast-conserving surgery incorporating oncoplastic surgery technique for centrally located breast cancers. We present our experience and outcome from Breast Surgery Unit, University Malaya Medical Center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis of 15 patients with central retroareolar breast cancer operated from 2012 to 2018 in University Malaya Medical Center. We assessed postoperative complications, margins, locoregional recurrence, and survival outcome. All patients received postoperative radiotherapy. Patients were followed-up 1 week, 1 month, 3 monthly for 1 year and 6 monthly for 5 years. RESULTS: Mean age of patients is 62 years. Mean follow-up is 51 months (15-84 months). All tumors were less than 5 cm (1-2.5 cm). Majority of the patients are stage 1 (6 patients/40%) and stage 2 (8 patients/ 53.3%). 2 patients had surgical site infection resolved with antibiotics. One patient had hematoma. None require reoperation. Tumor margins were clear in all patients. No locoregional recurrence. Overall survival is 100%. All are satisfied with their cosmetic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Grisotti flap is a volume displacement technique, which provides satisfactory cosmetic outcome for centrally located breast cancer. This evolutionary thinking leads us to changes in existing techniques with the purpose of achieving oncological safety while reaching for better esthetic results. Our 5 years' experience in Asian population showed that this technique is oncologically safe with good cosmetic outcomes and could be used selectively. It provides a good alternative in patients who are otherwise subjected for mastectomy. This relatively simple technique is a worthwhile endeavor and should be offered when feasible."

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating for nanocarriers gives them long circulation time in blood and makes them invisible to the reticuloendothelial system. Breast cancer cells have greater uptake of hyaluronic acid compared to normal cells as it binds to their overexpressed CD44 receptors. Since hypoxia plays an important role in cancer metastasis; we formulated PEG-PLGA nanoparticles coated with hyaluronic acid as targeted delivery system for doxorubicin (DOX) using nanoprecipitation method, and characterized them for chemical composition, size, surface charge, shape, and encapsulation efficiency. Then we tested them in vitro on hypoxia-optimized metastatic breast cancer cells. The nanoparticles were spherical with an average size of about 106 +/- 53 nm, a negative surface charge (-15 +/- 3 mV), and high encapsulation efficiency (73.3 +/- 4.1%). In vitro investigation with hypoxia-elevated CD44 MDA-MB-231 cells showed that hyaluronic acid-targeted nanoparticles maintained their efficacy despite hypoxia-induced drug resistance unlike free DOX and nontargeted nanoparticles. In conclusion, this study revealed a simple third generation nanoparticle formulation for targeted treatment of hypoxia-induced drug resistance in breast cancer metastatic cells. Further, optimization is needed including In vivo efficacy and nanoparticle-specific pharmacokinetic studies."

METHODS: As the endogenously produced N-acylethanolamine, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), reverses paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in mice, the main goals of this study were to examine if paclitaxel affects levels of endogenous PEA in the spinal cord of mice and whether exogenous administration of PEA provides protection from the occurrence of paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. We further examined whether inhibition of N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA), a hydrolytic PEA enzyme, would offer protection in mouse model of PIPN. RESULTS: Paclitaxel reduced PEA levels in the spinal cord, suggesting that dysregulation of this lipid signaling system may contribute to PIPN. Consistent with this idea, repeated administration of PEA partially prevented the paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. We next evaluated whether the selective NAAA inhibitor, AM9053, would prevent paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in mice. Acute administration of AM9053 dose-dependently reversed mechanical hypersensitivity through a PPAR-alpha mechanism, whereas repeated administration of AM9053 fully prevented the development of PIPN, without any evidence of tolerance. Moreover, AM9053 produced a conditioned place preference in paclitaxel treated mice, but not in control mice. This pattern of findings suggests a lack of intrinsic rewarding effects, but a reduction in the pain aversiveness induced by paclitaxel. Finally, AM9053, did not alter paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity in lung tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these studies suggest that NAAA represents a promising target to treat and prevent PIPN."

Tumor intrinsic subtype directs preferential metastasis to specific organs, with HER2-enriched tumors demonstrating the highest rates of metastasis to the liver, though all subtypes can grow in the liver. There is no singular established standard-of-care for BCLM; therapeutic selection is driven by histologic and molecular hallmarks of the primary tumor or biopsied metastasis samples. Given the poor prognosis of patients with hepatic spread, pre-clinical studies are necessary to identify and evaluate promising new treatment strategies. It is critical that these laboratory studies accurately recapitulate the BCLM disease process, standard progression, and histological attributes.

Among patients with invasive recurrence after treatment for DCIS, we compared patterns of first recurrence between those originally treated with BCS vs. mastectomy. METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, women with an invasive recurrence occurring >/= 6 months after initial treatment for DCIS were retrospectively identified. Clinicopathologic features and adjuvant treatment of the initial DCIS, as well as characteristics of first invasive recurrences, were compared between patients who had undergone BCS vs. mastectomy. RESULTS: 452 patients with an invasive recurrence after surgery for DCIS were identified: 367 patients (81%) had initially undergone BCS and 85 patients (19%) mastectomy. Patients originally treated with mastectomy were younger and were more likely to have had high grade, necrosis, and multifocal or multicentric DCIS (p < 0.001) compared with the BCS group. A higher proportion of invasive recurrences were local after BCS (93%; 343/367), whereas 88% (75/85) of recurrences after mastectomy were regional or distant (p < 0.001). The median time to first invasive recurrence was not different between surgical groups (BCS: 6.4 years vs. mastectomy: 5.5 years; p = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: Among women who experienced a first invasive recurrence after treatment for DCIS, those who had originally undergone mastectomy more commonly presented with advanced disease compared to those treated with BCS, likely related to the absence of the breast and the higher risk profile of their initial DCIS."

Differences in odds of having at least one breast cancer-related ED visit within 90 days post-surgery were estimated with logistic regression controlling for clinical and sociodemographic variables. Secondary analyses examined health care-related moderators of disparities. RESULTS: Hispanics and non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks had an increased likelihood of having an ED visit within 90 days of surgery compared to NH Whites [OR = 1.11 (1.04-1.18), p = 0.0016; OR = 1.38 (1.27-1.50), p < 0.0001, respectively]; the likelihood was reduced in Asian/Pacific Islanders [aOR = 0.77 (0.71-0.84), p < 0.0001]. Medicaid and Medicare (vs. commercial insurance) increased the likelihood of ED visit for NH Whites, and to a lesser degree for Hispanics and NH Blacks (p < 0.0001 for interaction). Receipt of surgery at an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center or at a for-profit (vs. non-profit) hospital was associated with reduced likelihood of ED visits for all groups. CONCLUSION: Racial/ethnic disparities in ED visits following breast cancer surgery persist after controlling for clinical and sociodemographic variables.

Today, the anti-cancer properties of natural compounds have attracted widespread attention from researchers worldwide. METHODS: In this study, we treated 4T1 tumor-bearing Balb/c mice with intraperitoneal injection of Auraptene, paraffin oil, and saline as two control groups. Body weight and tumor volume were measured before and after treatment. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining and immunohistochemistry of Ki-67 were used as markers of proliferation. In addition, ELISA assays were performed to assess serum IFN-gamma and IL-4 levels. RESULTS: There was no significant change in body weight in all animal groups before and after treatment. 10 days after the last treatment, Auraptene showed its anti-cancer effect, which was confirmed by the smaller tumor volume and H & E staining. In addition, Ki-67 expression levels were significantly reduced in tumor samples from the Auraptene-treated group compared to the paraffin oil and saline-treated groups. In addition, in tumor-bearing and normal mice receiving Auraptene treatment, IL-4 serum production levels were reduced, while serum levels of IFN-gamma were significantly up-regulated in tumor-bearing mice after Auraptene treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In the case of inhibition of tumor volume and Ki-67 proliferation markers, Auraptene can effectively inhibit tumor growth in breast cancer animal models. In addition, it might increases Th1 and CD8 + T cell responses after reducing IL-4 serum levels and IFN-gamma upregulation, respectively. However, further research is needed to clarify its mechanism of action."

Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) reduces the tissue overlap effect, thus improving image assessment. Some studies have suggested DBT might replace DxMM with at least equivalent performance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the replacement of DxMM with DBT in women recalled at screening. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify diagnostic paired cohort studies or RCTs comparing DBT vs DxMM, published in English that: reported accuracy outcomes, recruited women recalled for assessment at mammography screening, and included a reference standard. Subgroup analysis was performed over lesion characteristics. We provided pooled accuracy estimates and differences between tests using a quadrivariate model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: We included ten studies that reported specificity and sensitivity. One study included 7060 women while the remaining included between 52 and 738 women. DBT compared with DxMM showed a pooled difference for the sensitivity of 2% (95% CI 1%-3%) and a pooled difference for the specificity of 6% (95%CI 2%-11%). Restricting the analysis to the six studies that included women with microcalcification lesions gave similar results. In the context of a prevalence of 21% of breast cancer (BC) in recalled women, DBT probably detects 4 (95% CI 2-6) more BC cases and has 47 (95%CI 16-87) fewer false-positive results per 1000 assessments. The certainty of the evidence was moderate due to risk of bias. CONCLUSION: The evidence in the assessment of screen-recalled findings with DBT is sparse and of moderate certainty. DBT probably has higher sensitivity and specificity than DxMM. Women, health care providers and policymakers might value as relevant the reduction of false-positive results and related fewer invasive diagnostic procedures with DBT, without missing BC cases."

The cost of atezolizumab therapy is expensive, and its economic burden is an important problem. In this study, we evaluated the cost effectiveness of atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel therapy (AnP) compared with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (nP) for PD-L1-positive TNBC under Japanese medical conditions and environments using a Markov model. METHODS: The medical information was collected from data published by the IMpassion130 trial. A Markov model was established to simulate the number of patients in each disease state after AnP or nP therapy during each time period. As indices for cost effectiveness, total cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was used to assess the uncertainty of the model using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations with difference parameters. RESULTS: The QALYs for AnP treatment were longer than for nP treatment (1.12 vs 0.82 QALYs), but the total cost of AnP treatment was more expensive than that of nP treatment ( yen11,070,143 vs yen2,056,164). The ICER values comparing AnP treatment with nP treatment were yen30,208,143/QALY. The ICER/QALY was more expensive than the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of yen15,000,000 per QALY. To achieve a 50% cost-effective probability with a WTP threshold, the price of the atezolizumab should be reduced by 55.1%. CONCLUSIONS: AnP was not cost effective compared to nP for PD-L1-positive inoperable TNBC under the Japanese condition."

Neural networks and FDG PET-CT to predict the outcome of patients with breast cancer.","18F-FDG PET, Breast cancer, Metabolic tumor volume, Neural network",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,"BACKGROUND: Manual quantification of the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) from whole-body (18)F-FDG PET/CT is time consuming and therefore usually not applied in clinical routine. It has been shown that neural networks might assist nuclear medicine physicians in such quantification tasks. However, little is known if such neural networks have to be designed for a specific type of cancer or whether they can be applied to various cancers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a neural network in a cancer that was not used for its training. METHODS: Fifty consecutive breast cancer patients that underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT were included in this retrospective analysis. The PET-Assisted Reporting System (PARS) prototype that uses a neural network trained on lymphoma and lung cancer (18)F-FDG PET/CT data had to detect pathological foci and determine their anatomical location. Consensus reads of two nuclear medicine physicians together with follow-up data served as diagnostic reference standard; 1072 (18)F-FDG avid foci were manually segmented. The accuracy of the neural network was evaluated with regard to lesion detection, anatomical position determination, and total tumor volume quantification. RESULTS: If PERCIST measurable foci were regarded, the neural network displayed high per patient sensitivity and specificity in detecting suspicious (18)F-FDG foci (92%; CI = 79-97% and 98%; CI = 94-99%). If all FDG-avid foci were regarded, the sensitivity degraded (39%; CI = 30-50%). The localization accuracy was high for body part (98%; CI = 95-99%), region (88%; CI = 84-90%), and subregion (79%; CI = 74-84%). There was a high correlation of AI derived and manually segmented MTV (R(2) = 0.91; p < 0.001). AI-derived whole-body MTV (HR = 1.275; CI = 1.208-1.713; p < 0.001) was a significant prognosticator for overall survival. AI-derived lymph node MTV (HR = 1.190; CI = 1.022-1.384; p = 0.025) and liver MTV (HR = 1.149; CI = 1.001-1.318; p = 0.048) were predictive for overall survival in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Although trained on lymphoma and lung cancer, PARS showed good accuracy in the detection of PERCIST measurable lesions. Therefore, the neural network seems not prone to the clever Hans effect. However, the network has poor accuracy if all manually segmented lesions were used as reference standard. Both the whole body and organ-wise MTV were significant prognosticators of overall survival in advanced breast cancer."

We identified the gene Phospholipase C Delta 3 (PLCD3) as a potential oncogene in TC by conducting the whole transcriptome sequencing. Our study is to understand the oncogenic role of PLCD3 in TC. We verified the overexpression of PLCD3 in TC from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus databases, and a locally validated cohort. Clinical correlation analysis showed that PLCD3 expression was related to histological type, T stage, lymph node metastasis (LNM), and disease stage. The high expression of PLCD3 could be a distinguishing factor for TC and its LNM. The biological function was examined using small interfering RNA-transfected TC cell lines. Silenced PLCD3 could inhibit colony formation, migration, and invasion ability and promote apoptosis of TC cell lines. PLCD3 silencing reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition but induced the apoptotic progress. Further exploration revealed that PLCD3 might be associated with critical genes of the Hippo pathway. The expressions of RHOA, YAP1/TAZ, and their downstream targets were decreased significantly when PLCD3 was down-regulated. YAP1 overexpression rescued the tumor-suppressive effect caused by PLCD3 silencing. This study demonstrates that PLCD3 is an oncogene that supports tumorigenesis and progression in TC, and PLCD3 may be a potential target gene for TC treatment."

Early tumor relapse and progression are linked to the enrichment of a sub-fraction of cancer cells, termed breast tumor-initiating cells (BTICs), that undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and typically exhibit a basal-like CD44(high)/CD24(low) and/or ALDH1(high) phenotype with critical cancer stem-like features such as high self-renewal capacity and intrinsic (de novo) resistance to standard of care chemotherapy. One of the major mechanisms responsible for the intrinsic drug resistance of BTICs is their high ALDH1 activity leading to inhibition of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that aurora-A kinase (AURKA) is required to mediate TGF-beta-induced expression of the SNAI1 gene, enrichment of ALDH1(high) BTICs, self-renewal capacity, and chemoresistance in TNBC experimental models. Significantly, the combination of docetaxel (DTX) with dual TGF-beta and AURKA pharmacologic targeting impaired tumor relapse and the emergence of distant metastasis. We also showed in unique chemoresistant TNBC cells isolated from patient-derived TNBC brain metastasis that dual TGF-beta and AURKA pharmacologic targeting reversed cancer plasticity and enhanced the sensitivity of TNBC cells to DTX-based-chemotherapy. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time the critical role of AURKA oncogenic signaling in mediating TGF-beta-induced TNBC plasticity, chemoresistance, and tumor progression."

Here we assess whether a deep-learning system for volumetric heart segmentation on computed tomography (CT) scans developed in cardiovascular radiology can optimize treatment planning in radiation oncology. The system was trained using multi-center data (n = 858) with manual heart segmentations provided by cardiovascular radiologists. Validation of the system was performed in an independent real-world dataset of 5677 breast cancer patients treated with radiation therapy at the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center between 2008-2018. In a subset of 20 patients, the performance of the system was compared to eight radiation oncology experts by assessing segmentation time, agreement between experts, and accuracy with and without deep-learning assistance. To compare the performance to segmentations used in the clinic, concordance and failures (defined as Dice < 0.85) of the system were evaluated in the entire dataset. The system was successfully applied without retraining. With deep-learning assistance, segmentation time significantly decreased (4.0 min [IQR 3.1-5.0] vs. 2.0 min [IQR 1.3-3.5]; p < 0.001), and agreement increased (Dice 0.95 [IQR = 0.02]; vs. 0.97 [IQR = 0.02], p < 0.001). Expert accuracy was similar with and without deep-learning assistance (Dice 0.92 [IQR = 0.02] vs. 0.92 [IQR = 0.02]; p = 0.48), and not significantly different from deep-learning-only segmentations (Dice 0.92 [IQR = 0.02]; p >/= 0.1).

Whether or not similar risk associations are seen when these lesions are detected in mammographically screened populations is unknown. To address this, we examined the variation in BBD and breast cancer risk associations by the calendar time of BBD diagnosis (pre- vs. post-mammography era [before vs. 1985 and after]) in a nested case-control study within the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII BBD subcohort (488 cases; 1908 controls). We performed logistic regression analysis, adjusting for matching factors and potential confounders, to estimate odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between BBD subtype (non-proliferative, proliferative without atypia, proliferative with atypical hyperplasia (AH)) and subsequent breast cancer risk. When compared with non-proliferative lesions, both proliferative lesions without atypia (PWA) and AHs were associated with similar levels of risk in the pre-mammographic (pre) and post-mammographic (post) time periods (PWA: OR [95% CI] = 1.73 [1.27, 2.36] pre vs. 1.12 [0.73, 1.74] post; AH: 4.41 [2.90, 6.70] pre vs. 3.69 [2.21, 6.15] post).

Macrometastases contained significantly fewer B cells and T cells (CD4(+)/CD8(+)/regulatory) than reactive nodes (p = 0.02). Similarly, pathway analysis of the perfusate proteome (119/1453 proteins significantly differentially expressed) showed that immune function was diminished in macrometastases in favour of 'extracellular matrix degradation'; only 'neutrophil degranulation' was preserved. Qualitative comparison of the perfusate proteome to that of node-positive pancreatic and prostatic adenocarcinoma also highlighted 'neutrophil degranulation' as a contributing factor to nodal metastasis. Thus, metastasis-induced changes in the REPLICANT perfusate proteome are detectable, and could facilitate biomarker discovery."

As such, accurate determination of nodal status after neoadjuvant therapy and before surgery impacts surgical management. There are scarce data on the diagnostic accuracy of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for nodal evaluation after neoadjuvant therapy in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), a diffusely growing tumor type. We retrospectively analyzed patients with stage 1-3 ILC who underwent pre-operative breast MRI after either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy at our institution between 2006 and 2019. Two breast radiologists reviewed MRIs and evaluated axillary nodes for suspicious features. All patients underwent either sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection. We evaluated sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, and overall accuracy of the post-treatment breast MRI in predicting pathologic nodal status. Of 79 patients, 58.2% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 41.8% neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of MRI were significantly higher in the neoadjuvant endocrine therapy cohort than in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (66.7 vs. 37.9%, p = 0.012 and 70.6 vs. 40%, p = 0.007, respectively), while overall accuracy was similar. Upstaging from clinically node negative to pathologically node positive occurred in 28.0 and 41.7%, respectively. In clinically node positive patients, those with an abnormal post-treatment MRI had a significantly higher proportion of patients with >/=4 positive nodes on pathology compared to those with a normal MRI (61.1 versus 16.7%, p = 0.034). Overall, accuracy of breast MRI for predicting nodal status after neoadjuvant therapy in ILC was low in both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy cohorts. However, post-treatment breast MRI may help identify patients with a high burden of nodal disease (>/=4 positive nodes), which could impact pre-operative systemic therapy decisions. Further studies are needed to assess other imaging modalities to evaluate for nodal disease following neoadjuvant therapy and to improve clinical staging in patients with ILC."

Here, we identified E26 transformation-specific homologous factor (EHF) as a key molecule in decreasing the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer (PC) cells to CSCs' niche stimulus. We also explored a therapeutic strategy to restore the expression of EHF. DESIGN: We used a LSL-Kras(G12D/+)mice, LSL-Trp53(R172H/+) and Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mouse model and samples from patients with PC. Immunostaining, flow cytometry, sphere formation assays, anchorage-independent growth assay, in vivo tumourigenicity, reverse transcription PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase analyses were conducted in this study. RESULTS: CXCL12 derived from pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) mediates the crosstalk between PC cells and PSCs to promote PC stemness. Tumorous EHF suppressed CSC stemness by decreasing the sensitivity of PC to CXCL12 stimulus and inhibiting the crosstalk between PC and CSC-supportive niches. Mechanically, EHF suppressed the transcription of the CXCL12 receptor CXCR4. EHF had a cell autonomous role in suppressing cancer stemness by inhibiting the transcription of Sox9, Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog. Rosiglitazone suppressed PC stemness and inhibited the crosstalk between PC and PSCs by upregulating EHF. Preclinical KPC mouse cohorts demonstrated that rosiglitazone sensitised PDAC to gemcitabine therapy. CONCLUSIONS: EHF decreased the sensitivity of PC to the stimulus from PSC-derived CSC-supportive niche by negatively regulating tumorous CXCR4. Rosiglitazone could be used to target PC stem cells and the crosstalk between CSCs and their niche by upregulating EHF."

Six BC-related genes (Cathepsin L2, MMP11, CyclinB1, Aurora A, Survivin, and Ki67) were screened using univariate and multivariate COX regression, and correlate clinical follow-up with immunohistochemical expression (designated as 6-IHC). All the included patients were divided randomly at a 7:3 ratio into training and testing cohorts.

The sources used were population-based cancer registries of Goiania, hospital-based cancer registry of Acre, Sao Paulo, and Porto Velho; Special Indigenous Health Districts databases of Acre, Goiania, and Sao Paulo; Mortality Information System, and Rio Branco's public and private laboratories' reports. Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) was calculated using cancer incidence rates of Goiania as reference. RESULTS: From 137 cancer cases, 51.8% occurred in women and 32.1% in people aged 70 + . Among men, the most frequent cancer sites were stomach (25.8%), liver (15.1%), colorectal (7.6%), leukemia (7.6%), and prostate (6.1%). Among women, the most frequent were cervical (50.7%), stomach (8.5%), leukemia (5.6%), liver (4.3%), and breast (4.3%). Among men, there was an excess of cancer cases for stomach (SIR=1.75; 95%CI:1.67-1.83), liver (SIR=1.77; 95%CI:1.66-1.88), and leukemia (SIR=1.64; 95%CI:1.49-1.78). In women, an excess of cancer cases was observed for cervical (SIR=4.49; 95%CI:4.34-4.64) and liver (SIR=2.11; 95%CI:1.88-2.34). A lower cancer incidence for prostate (SIR=0.06; 95%CI:0.05-0.07) and female breast (SIR=0.12; 95%CI:0.11-0.14) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical, stomach, and liver cancers corresponded to 52% of the cases and were highly incident among the Brazilian indigenous population of Western Amazon compared to non-indigenous counterparts. Despite the low frequency of breast and prostate cancer, the fact they were present among indigenous peoples suggests a complex epidemiological transition framework in these populations."

The treatment strategies are diverse, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite multimodality treatment, the response rate is unsatisfactory. DNA repair and genetic instability are highly associated with carcinogenesis and treatment outcomes in oral squamous cell cancer, affecting cell growth and proliferation. Therefore, focusing on DNA repair and genetic instability interactions could be a potential target for improving the outcomes of OSCC patients. DNA polymerase-beta (POLB) is an important enzyme in base excision repair and contributes to gene instability, leading to tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis. The aim of our study was to confirm POLB regulates the growth of OSCC cells through modulation of cell cycle and chromosomal instability. We analyzed a tissue array from 133 OSCC patients and discovered that low POLB expression was associated with advanced tumor stage and poor overall survival. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, low POLB expression and advanced lymph node status were significantly associated with poor survival. By performing in vitro studies on model cell lines, we demonstrated that POLB silencing regulated cell cycles, exacerbated mitotic abnormalities and enhanced cell proliferation. After POLB depletion, OSCC cells showed chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. Thus, POLB is an important maintainer of karyotypic stability in OSCC cells."

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using the varimax rotation method was performed to improve the model, the revised NDBCSS (NDBCSS-R), which showed a good Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value, Bartlett's test of sphericity, and internal consistency reliability. The NDBCSS-R showed improved indices compared with NDBCSS, including: chi-square fit statistics/degree of freedom (CMIN/DF), goodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI), normed fix index (NFI), relative fit index (RFI), incremental fix index (IFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), comparative fix index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), root mean square residual (RMR), parsimonious goodness-fit-index (PGFI), and parsimonious normed fit index (PNFI). In conclusion, the improved NDBCSS-R can provide health professionals with an early understanding of the stress levels of women with breast cancer so that they can provide immediate medical intervention to prevent vicious cycles in a timely manner."

METHODS: The objective of this study was to compare the yield of khellin and visnagin obtained using different conventional solvents and supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE) with carbon dioxide (containing 5% methanol as co-solvent). Water, acetone and ethanol (30% and 95%) were selected as conventional solvents. RESULTS: Highest extract yield was obtained from 30% ethanol (15.44%), while SCFE gave the lowest yield (4.50%). However, the percentage of furanochromones were highest in SCFE (30.1%), and lowest in boiling water extract (5.95%). HPLC analysis of conventional solvent extracts showed other coumarins that did not appear in supercritical fluid extraction chromatogram due to non-selectivity of solvent extraction. Ammi visnaga extracts as well as standard khellin and visnagin were tested for their cytotoxic activity using sulforhodamine B assay on breast cancer (MCF-7) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2) cell lines. Results revealed a strong cytotoxic activity (IC50 < 20 microg/mL) for the SCFE and standard compounds (khellin and visnagin) (IC50 ranging between 12.54 +/- 0.57 and 17.53 +/- 1.03 microg/mL). However, ethanol and acetone extracts had moderate cytotoxic activity (IC50 20-90 microg/mL) and aqueous extract had a weak activity (IC50 > 90 microg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, supercritical fluid extraction is an efficient, relatively safe, and cheap technique that yielded a more selective purified extract with better cytotoxic activity."

In this study, the mechanism of cytotoxicity of phospholipid-GNRs towards MCF-7 cells was investigated using mass spectrometry-based global metabolic profiling and compared to PEGylated counterparts. The results showed that when compared to PEG-GNRs, phospholipid-GNRs induced significant and more pronounced impact on the metabolic profile of MCF-7 cells. Phospholipid-GNRs significantly decreased the levels of metabolic intermediates and end-products associated with cellular energy metabolisms resulting in dysfunction in TCA cycle, a reduction in glycolytic activity, and imbalance of the redox state. Additionally, phospholipid-GNRs disrupted several metabolism pathways essential for the normal growth and proliferation of cancer cells including impairment in purine, pyrimidine, and glutathione metabolisms accompanied by lower amino acid pools. On the other hand, the effects of PEG-GNRs were limited to alteration of glycolysis and pyrimidine metabolism. The current work shed light on the importance of metabolomics as a valuable analytical approach to explore the molecular effects of GNRs with different surface chemistry on cancer cell and highlights metabolic targets that might serve as promising treatment strategy in cancer."

Given that the aetiologies of such diseases extend beyond a single biological entity, and that essential biological information can be carried by all data regardless of data type, integrative analyses are needed to identify clinically relevant patterns. To facilitate such analyses, we present a permutation-based framework for random forest methods which simultaneously allows the unbiased integration of mixed-type data and assessment of relative feature importance. Through simulation studies and machine learning datasets, the performance of the approach was evaluated. The results showed minimal multicollinearity and limited overfitting. To further assess the performance, the permutation-based framework was applied to high-dimensional mixed-type data from two independent breast cancer cohorts. Reproducibility and robustness of our approach was demonstrated by the concordance in relative feature importance between the cohorts, along with consistencies in clustering profiles. One of the identified clusters was shown to be prognostic for clinical outcome after standard-of-care adjuvant chemotherapy and outperformed current intrinsic molecular breast cancer classifications."

The conversion of the prodrug tamoxifen into the most active metabolite endoxifen is mainly catalyzed by the enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Genetic variation in the CYP2D6 gene leads to altered enzyme activity, which influences endoxifen formation and thereby potentially therapy outcome. The association between genetically compromised CYP2D6 activity and low endoxifen plasma concentrations is generally accepted, and it was shown that tamoxifen dose increments in compromised patients resulted in higher endoxifen concentrations. However, the correlation between CYP2D6 genotype and clinical outcome is still under debate. This has led to genotype-based tamoxifen dosing recommendations by the Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium (CPIC) in 2018, whereas in 2019, the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) discouraged the use of CYP2D6 genotyping in clinical practice for tamoxifen therapy. This paper describes the latest developments on CYP2D6 genotyping in relation to endoxifen plasma concentrations and tamoxifen-related clinical outcome. Therefore, we focused on Pharmacogenetic publications from 2018 (CPIC publication) to 2021 in order to shed a light on the current status of this debate."

Unfortunately, many epithelial tumors respond poorly to immunotherapy, and the reasons for this are not well understood. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most frequent non-neoplastic cell type in most solid tumors, and they are emerging as a key player in immunotherapy resistance. A range of immortalized CAF lines will be essential tools that will allow us to understand immune responses against cancer and develop novel strategies for cancer immunotherapy. To study the effect of CAFs on T cell proliferation, we created and characterized a number of novel immortalized human CAFs lines (Im-CAFs) from human breast, colon, and pancreatic carcinomas. Im-CAFs shared similar phenotypes, matrix remodeling and contraction capabilities, and growth and migration rates compared to the primary CAFs. Using primary isolates from breast carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, we report that CAFs across major tumor types are able to potently suppress T cell proliferation in vitro. Im-CAFs retained this property. Im-CAFs are a key tool that will provide important insights into the mechanisms of CAF-mediated T cell suppression through techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 modification, molecular screens, and pipeline drug testing."

The present study is a comprehensive overview, extended with a bioinformatics analysis of TCGA cohorts, including breast, bladder, cervical, colon, kidney, lung, ovary, prostate and rectum carcinomas. We performed global expression profiling of the Notch pathway core components and downstream targets. For this purpose, we implemented the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection algorithm to reduce the dimensions. Furthermore, we determined the optimal cutpoint using Evaluate Cutpoint software to established disease-free and overall survival with respect to particular Notch members. Our results demonstrated separation between tumors and their corresponding normal tissue, as well as between tumors in general. The differentiation of the Notch pathway, at its various stages, in terms of expression and survival resulted in distinct profiles of biological processes such as proliferation, adhesion, apoptosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, whether oncogenic or suppressive, Notch signaling is proven to be associated with various types of malignancies, and thus may be of interest as a potential therapeutic target."

Thus, more effective therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising therapeutic tools and targets, as they play significant roles in regulating key cellular processes by suppressing gene expression. However, additive opportunities involving miRNAs have been underexplored. For example, both miR-34a and miR-200c individually suppress the development of different types of cancer, but the cellular effects of their combined actions remain unknown. Here, we show that miR-34a and miR-200c levels are reduced in breast tumors compared to adjacent normal tissues and that this additively predicts poor patient survival. In addition, in cell lines, miR-34a and miR-200c additively induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, while also inhibiting proliferation, invasion, migration, stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, both miRNA-34a and miR-200c directly target HIF1-alpha and subsequently downregulate VEGFR, MMP9 and CXCR4, although combined miRNA-34a and miR-200c delivery suppresses mouse xenograft tumor development as effectively as individual delivery. We establish a model, supported by in vitro and clinical data, which collectively suggest that the co-delivery of miR-34a and miR-200c represents a promising novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients."

High gammadelta T cell infiltration was associated with better survival in patients with PIK3CA wild-type tumors, but the difference was not significant in the subgroup with PIK3CA-mutated tumors.

While the number of efficient anticancer therapies increased in the past 20 years, treatments targeting the invasive properties of metastatic tumour cells are still awaited. Various studies analysing invasive breast cancer cell lines have demonstrated that Arf6 is an important player of the migratory and invasive processes. These observations make Arf6 and its regulators potential therapeutic targets. As of today, no drug effective against Arf6 has been identified, with one explanation being that the activation of Arf6 is dependent on the presence of lipid membranes that are rarely included in drug screening. To overcome this issue we have set up a fluorescence-based high throughput screening that follows overtime the activation of Arf6 at the surface of lipid membranes. Using this unique screening assay, we isolated several compounds that affect Arf6 activation, among which the antibiotic chlortetracycline (CTC) appeared to be the most promising. In this report, we describe CTC in vitro biochemical characterization and show that it blocks both the Arf6-stimulated collective migration and cell invasion in a 3D collagen I gel of the invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.

All axillary lymph nodes were manually delineated on the T2W MR images, and quantitative radiomics features were extracted from the delineated regions. Data were partitioned patient-wise to train 100 models using different splits for the training and validation cohorts to account for multiple lymph nodes per patient and class imbalance. Features were selected in the training cohorts using recursive feature elimination with repeated 5-fold cross-validation, followed by the development of random forest models. The performance of the models was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC).

Taxanes exhibit low water solubility that require formulations that involve side effects. These drugs are often associated with dose-limiting toxicities and with the appearance of multi-drug resistance (MDR). Here, we propose targeting tubulin with compounds directed to the colchicine site, as their smaller size offer pharmacokinetic advantages and make them less prone to MDR efflux. We have prepared 52 new Microtubule Destabilizing Sulfonamides (MDS) that mostly avoid MDR-mediated resistance and with improved aqueous solubility.

Due to the pivotal role of the presence/absence of specific receptors to luminal A, luminal B, HER-2+, and TNBC in the molecular classification of breast cancer, the lack of these receptors has accounted for the aforementioned limitation. Thereupon, in an attempt to participate in the ongoing research endeavors to overcome such a limitation, the conducted study adopts a combination strategy as a therapeutic paradigm for TNBC, which has proven notable results with respect to both: improving patient outcomes and survivability rates. The study hinges upon an investigation of a promising NPs platform for CD44 mediated theranostic that can be combined with JAK/STAT inhibitors for the treatment of TNBC. The ability of momelotinib (MMB), which is a JAK/STAT inhibitor, to sensitize the TNBC to apoptosis inducer (CFM-4.16) has been evaluated in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. MMB + CFM-4.16 combination with a combination index (CI) </=0.5, has been selected for in vitro and in vivo studies. MMB has been combined with CD44 directed polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) loaded with CFM-4.16, namely CD44-T-PNPs, which selectively delivered the payload to CD44 overexpressing TNBC with a significant decrease in cell viability associated with a high dose reduction index (DRI). The mechanism underlying their synergism is based on the simultaneous downregulation of P-STAT3 and the up-regulation of CARP-1, which has induced ROS-dependent apoptosis leading to caspase 3/7 elevation, cell shrinkage, DNA damage, and suppressed migration. CD44-T-PNPs showed a remarkable cellular internalization, demonstrated by uptake of a Rhodamine B dye in vitro and S0456 (NIR dye) in vivo. S0456 was conjugated to PNPs to form CD44-T-PNPs/S0456 that simultaneously delivered CFM-4.16 and S0456 parenterally with selective tumor targeting, prolonged circulation, minimized off-target distribution."

Since patients with TNBC frequently show a quicker relapse and metastatic progression compared to other breast cancer subtypes, we hypothesized that cancer stem cells (CSC) could have a role in TNBC. To identify putative TNBC CSC-associated targets, we compared the gene expression profiles of CSC-enriched tumorspheres and their parental cells grown as monolayer. Among the up-regulated genes coding for cell membrane-associated proteins, we selected Teneurin 4 (TENM4), involved in cell differentiation and deregulated in tumors of different histotypes, as the object for this study. Meta-analysis of breast cancer datasets shows that TENM4 mRNA is up-regulated in invasive carcinoma specimens compared to normal breast and that high expression of TENM4 correlates with a shorter relapse-free survival in TNBC patients. TENM4 silencing in mammary cancer cells significantly impaired tumorsphere-forming ability, migratory capacity and Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) phosphorylation. Moreover, we found higher levels of TENM4 in plasma from tumor-bearing mice and TNBC patients compared to the healthy controls. Overall, our results indicate that TENM4 may act as a novel biomarker and target for the treatment of TNBC."

While commonly used in retrospective analyses, our aim is to investigate the use of drug prediction methods for the generation of novel drug discovery hypotheses. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a severe clinical challenge in need of new therapies. (2) Methods: We used an established machine learning approach to build models of drug response based on cell line transcriptome data, which we then applied to patient tumor data to obtain predicted sensitivity scores for hundreds of drugs in over 1000 breast cancer patients. We then examined the relationships between predicted drug response and patient clinical features. (3) Results: Our analysis recapitulated several suspected vulnerabilities in TNBC and identified a number of compounds-of-interest. AZD-1775, a Wee1 inhibitor, was predicted to have preferential activity in TNBC (p < 2.2 x 10(-16)) and its efficacy was highly associated with TP53 mutations (p = 1.2 x 10(-46)). We validated these findings using independent cell line screening data and pathway analysis. Additionally, co-administration of AZD-1775 with standard-of-care paclitaxel was able to inhibit tumor growth (p < 0.05) and increase survival (p < 0.01) in a xenograft mouse model of TNBC.

Oncogenic miR-21 is upregulated in many cancers, including BrCa, and is associated with poor survival and treatment resistance. We sought to determine the role of miR-21 in BrCa tumor initiation, progression and treatment response. In a triple-negative BrCa model, radiation exposure increased miR-21 in both primary tumor and metastases. In vitro, miR-21 knockdown decreased survival in all BrCa subtypes in the presence of radiation. The role of miR-21 in BrCa initiation was evaluated by implanting wild-type miR-21 BrCa cells into genetically engineered mouse models where miR-21 was intact, heterozygous or globally ablated. Tumors were unable to grow in the mammary fat pads of miR-21(-/-) mice, and grew in ~50% of miR-21(+/-) and 100% in miR-21(+/+) mice. The contribution of miR-21 to progression and metastases was tested by crossing miR-21(-/-) mice with mice that spontaneously develop BrCa. The global ablation of miR-21 significantly decreased the tumorigenesis and metastases of BrCa, while sensitizing tumors to radio- and chemotherapeutic agents via Fas/FasL-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, targeting miR-21 alone or in combination with various radio or cytotoxic therapies may represent novel and efficacious therapeutic modalities for the future treatment of BrCa patients."

Here, we show that expression levels of both subunits of the cystine/glutamate antiporter xCT determine the expression of GPX4 in breast cancer, and that upregulation of the xCT/selenocysteine biosynthesis/GPX4 production axis paradoxically renders the cancer cells more sensitive to certain types of ferroptotic stimuli. We find that GPX4 is strongly upregulated in a subset of breast cancer tissues compared to matched normal samples, and that this is tightly correlated with the increased expression of the xCT subunits SLC7A11 and SLC3A2. Erastin depletes levels of the antioxidant selenoproteins GPX4 and GPX1 in breast cancer cells by inhibiting xCT-dependent extracellular reduction which is required for selenium uptake and selenocysteine biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, while breast cancer cells are resistant compared to nontransformed cells against oxidative stress inducing drugs, at the same time they are hypersensitive to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis induced by Erastin or Rsl-3, indicating that they are 'addicted' to the xCT/GPX4 axis. Our findings provide a strategic basis for targeting the anti-ferroptotic machinery of breast cancer cells depending on their xCT status, which can be further explored."

The expression level of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in invasive breast cancer tissue is higher than in adjacent non-cancerous tissue. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of penisuloxazin A (PNSA), a novel C- terminal inhibitor of HSP90, on metastasis of breast cancer cells and related mechanism in vitro. We found that PNSA obviously affected adhesion, migration, and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 cells and Trastuzumab-resistant JIMT-1 cells. Furthermore, PNSA was capable of reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of MDA-MB-231 cells with change of cell morphology. PNSA increases E-cadherin expression followed by decreasing amounts of N-cadherin, vimentin, and matrix metalloproteinases9 (MMP9) and proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinases2 (MMP2) and MMP9. Comparatively, the N-terminal inhibitor of HSP90 17-allyl-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) had no effect on EMT of MDA-MB-231 cells. PNSA was uncovered to reduce the stability of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) proteins and thereby inhibiting their downstream signaling transductions by inhibition of HSP90. In addition, PNSA reduced the expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) to promote natural killer (NK) cells to kill breast cancer cells with a dose far less than that of cytotoxicity to NK cell itself, implying the potential of PNSA to enhance immune surveillance against metastasis in vivo. All these results indicate that PNSA is a promising anti-metastasis agent worthy of being studied in the future."

One of the important factors of the TME is microRNAs (miRs) that regulate target gene expression at a post transcriptional level. MiRs have been found to be dysregulated in tumor as well as in stromal cells and they emerged as important regulators of tumorigenesis. In fact, miRs regulate almost all hallmarks of cancer, thus making them attractive tools and targets for novel anti-tumoral treatment strategies. Tumor to stroma cell cross-propagation of miRs to regulate protumoral functions has been a salient feature of the TME. MiRs can either act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes (oncomiRs) and both miR mimics as well as miR inhibitors (antimiRs) have been used in preclinical trials to alter cancer and stromal cell phenotypes. Owing to their cascading ability to regulate upstream target genes and their chemical nature, which allows specific pharmacological targeting, miRs are attractive targets for anti-tumor therapy. In this review, we cover a recent update on our understanding of dysregulated miRs in the TME and provide an overview of how these miRs are involved in current cancer-therapeutic approaches from bench to bedside."

Recent advances in genomic analysis based on circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA have enabled the development of targeted therapies based on genetic mutations in residual tumor cells. A paradigm shift involving the application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has enabled the prediction of treatment response and long-term prognoses; additional adjuvant chemotherapy targeting remaining tumor cells after NAC improves survival. The activation of antitumor immunity by anticancer agents may be involved in the eradication of residual tumor cells.

This mechanism suggests a higher drug sensitivity in the context of KRAS mutant, HIF-1alpha-high and/or Gal3-high cancer cells, such as those found, in particular, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The low toxicity of conglobatin further indicates a beneficial on-target toxicity profile for Hsp90/Cdc37 interface inhibitors.

The anchorage-independent soft-agar colony formation assay has been widely used as a bridge between adherent cell cultures and animal tumor studies, providing a reliable in vitro tool to predict the tumorigenicity of cancer cells. However, this functional assay is limited in its utility for molecular mechanistic studies, as currently there is no reliable method that allows the extraction of biological macromolecules from cells embedded in soft-agar matrices, especially in experimental conditions where no visible colonies form. We developed a set of new methods that enable the extraction of DNA, RNA and proteins directly from cells embedded in soft agar, allowing for a wide range of molecular signaling analysis. Using the new methods and human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), we studied the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the ability of HMECs to form colonies in soft agar. We found that, when cultured in soft agar instead of in adherent cultures, immortalized non-malignant HME-hTERT cells upregulated the epithelial program, which was noted to be necessary for their survival in this anchorage-independent condition. Overexpression of SV40 small T antigen (ST) or the EMT master-regulator SNAI1 negates this requirement and significantly enhances colony formation in soft agar driven by mutant-RAS. Interestingly, we found that, similar to SNAI1, ST also promotes EMT changes in HMECs, providing further support for EMT as a prerequisite for the efficient anchorage-independent colony formation driven by mutant-RAS in our HMEC model."

We applied two-sample Mendelian randomization to investigate whether genetically raised bilirubin levels are causally associated with the risk of ten cancers (pancreas, kidney, endometrium, ovary, breast, prostate, lung, Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma, and neuroblastoma). The number of cases and their matched controls of European descent ranged from 122,977 and 105,974 for breast cancer to 1200 and 6417 for Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively. A total of 115 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated (p < 5 x 10(-8)) with circulating total bilirubin, extracted from a genome-wide association study in the UK Biobank, were used as instrumental variables. One SNP (rs6431625) in the promoter region of the uridine-diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase1A1 (UGT1A1) gene explained 16.9% and the remaining 114 SNPs (non-UGT1A1 SNPs) explained 3.1% of phenotypic variance in circulating bilirubin levels. A one-standarddeviation increment in circulating bilirubin ( approximately 4.4 micromol/L), predicted by non-UGT1A1 SNPs, was inversely associated with risk of squamous cell lung cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma (odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.99, P 0.04 and OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.99, p 0.04, respectively), which was confirmed after removing potential pleiotropic SNPs. In contrast, a positive association was observed with the risk of breast cancer after removing potential pleiotropic SNPs (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.20, p 0.002). There was little evidence for robust associations with the other seven cancers investigated. Genetically raised bilirubin levels were inversely associated with risk of squamous cell lung cancer as well as Hodgkin's lymphoma and positively associated with risk of breast cancer. Further studies are required to investigate the utility of bilirubin as a low-cost clinical marker to improve risk prediction for certain cancers."

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of breast cancer patients treated by nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) and IPBR in our institution during the two-year period from January 2018 to December 2019. Patients were divided into two groups based on the plane of implant placement: SM versus PP. RESULTS: 177 patients who received IPBR after NSM were included in the study; implants were positioned in a SM plane in 95 patients and in a PP plane in 82 patients. The two cohorts were similar for mean age (44 years and 47 years in the SM and PP groups, respectively) and follow-up (20 months and 16 months, respectively). The mean operative time was 70 min shorter in the PP group. No significant differences were observed in length of hospital stay or overall major complication rates. Statistically significant advantages were observed in the PP group in terms of aesthetic results, chronic pain, shoulder dysfunction, and skin sensibility (p < 0.05), as well as a trend of better outcomes for sports activity and sexual/relationship life. Cost analysis revealed that PP-IPBR was also economically advantageous over SM-IPBR. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary experience seems to confirm that PP positioning of a polyurethane-coated implant is a safe, reliable and effective method to perform IPBR after NSM."

In humans, DSBs are repaired mainly by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HRR). Single-strand annealing (SSA), another DSB repair system, uses homologous repeats flanking a DSB to join DNA ends and is error-prone, as it removes DNA fragments between repeats along with one repeat. Many DNA deletions observed in cancer cells display homology at breakpoint junctions, suggesting the involvement of SSA. When multiple DSBs occur in different chromosomes, SSA may result in chromosomal translocations, essential in the pathogenesis of many cancers. Inhibition of RAD52 (RAD52 Homolog, DNA Repair Protein), the master regulator of SSA, results in decreased proliferation of BRCA1/2 (BRCA1/2 DNA Repair Associated)-deficient cells, occurring in many hereditary breast and ovarian cancer cases. Therefore, RAD52 may be targeted in synthetic lethality in cancer. SSA may modulate the response to platinum-based anticancer drugs and radiation. SSA may increase the efficacy of the CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR associated 9) genome editing and reduce its off-target effect.

Hippocampi of female mice inoculated with 4T1 BCCs were examined over time by hematoxylin-eosin, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Well-established metastases were observed at seven days, increasing thereafter. BCCs entering brain parenchyma presented mesenchymal, migratory, and proliferative features; however, with time, they increasingly expressed epithelial markers, reflecting a mesenchymal-epithelial transition. BCCs also expressed platelet-derived growth factor-B, beta4 integrin, and focal adhesion kinase, suggesting autocrine and/or paracrine regulation with adhesion signaling activation, while balance between Rac1 and RhoA was associated with the motility status. Intercellular communication via gap junctions was clear among BCCs, and between BCCs and endothelial cells. Thrombin accumulation, junctional protein impairment, and vesicular proteins increase reflect BBB alterations related with extravasation.

However, the link between beta1-integrin and this signaling complex is unknown. In this study, in metastatic breast (MDA-MB-231) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cells, we report that integrin-linked kinase (ILK) integrates beta1-integrin with this signaling complex to regulate invadopodia activity and invasion. Proximity ligation assay experiments demonstrate that, in invadopodia, ILK associates with beta1-integrin, NHE1 and the scaffold proteins p(T567)-ezrin and NHERF1. Activation of beta1-integrin increased both invasion and invadopodia activity, which were specifically blocked by inhibition of either NHE1 or ILK.

The role of this fruit in the prevention and treatment of various malignant pathologies has been long time cited in both scientific and non-scientific literature, making thus important to identify its involvement in the pathophysiological processes. The treatment for breast cancer had focused on the inhibition of the mechanisms that governs the estrogen activity. These mechanisms are covered either by the antagonism of the estrogen receptor (ER) or by the inhibition of the estrogen synthesis. Our interest in identifying a bioactive compound rich in polyphenols, which induces both the antagonism of the estrogen receptor, and the inhibition of the estrogen synthesis, revealed us the pomegranate fruit and its derivatives: peel and seeds. Pomegranates' chemical composition include many biological active substances such as flavonols, flavanols, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, ellagitannins and gallotannins. Materials and Methods: We performed a review of the scientific literature by using the following keywords: ""pomegranate"", ""breast cancer"", ""Punica granatum"", ""pomegranate polyphenols"". Our search was performed in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, and it included only original research written in English from the last 20 years. None of the articles were excluded due to affiliation. A total number of 28 original papers, which mentioned the beneficial activity of pomegranate against breast cancer, were selected. Both clinical and preclinical studies were considered for this review. Results: Recent discoveries pointed out that polyphenols from Punica granatum possess strong anti-cancer activity, exhibited by a variety of mechanisms, such as anti-estrogenic, anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-metastatic. Pomegranate extracts induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, and induced cytotoxicity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, several polyphenols extracted from pomegranate inhibited the invasion potential, migration and viability of breast cancer cells. The effects of pomegranate juice on serum estrogens and other sexual hormones levels were also investigated on two human cohorts. Conclusions: Punica granatum represents a promising area in oncology. The large availability and low cost, associated with the lack of side effects, made from this natural product a great strategy for the management of breast cancer. There are several mechanistic studies in mouse models and in breast cancer cell lines, suggesting the possible pathways through which polyphenols from pomegranate extracts act, but larger and better-controlled studies are necessary in the future. Only two small clinical trials were conducted on humans until now, but their results are contradictory and should be considered preliminary."

Herein we explored genomic alterations in these processes using RNA-seq and mutation data from TCGA and METABRIC datasets, and analyzed them using a bioinformatic pipeline in search of those with prognostic and predictive capability which could qualify as subjects of drug research. Amplification of UBE2T, UBE2C, and BIRC5 conferred a worse prognosis in luminal A/B and basal-like tumors, luminal A/B tumors, and luminal A tumors, respectively. Higher UBE2T expression levels were predictive of a lower rate of pathological complete response in triple negative breast cancer patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whereas UBE2C and BIRC5 expression was higher in luminal A patients with tumor relapse within 5 years of endocrine therapy or chemotherapy. The transcriptomic signatures of USP9X and USP7 gene mutations also conferred worse prognosis in luminal A, HER2-enriched, and basal-like tumors, and in luminal A tumors, respectively. In conclusion, we identified and characterized the clinical value of a group of genomic alterations in ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and neddylation enzymes, with potential for drug development in breast cancer."

This plant is widely used in Mexican traditional medicine for breast cancer treatment. Despite that, there are few studies on D. bicolor. Two response surface designs were applied to establish the best conditions of the liberation of antioxidants from D. bicolor, which were determined by DPPH* and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) techniques. The total phenolic content was evaluated by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The results showed that D. bicolor is a source of antioxidants (669-2128 mg ET/100 g and 553-1920 mg EFe(2+)/100 g, respectively) and phenolic compounds (2232-9929 mg EGA/100 g). Among the physical factors that were analyzed, the temperature was the determinant factor to liberate the compounds of interest by using low concentrations of the sample and short times of extraction. The French press was the most efficient method, obtaining values of antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds even higher than those reported by using extraction methods with solvents such as methanol."

TRAIL is able to induce apoptosis through engagement of its death receptors DR4 and DR5 in a wide variety of tumor cells while sparing vital normal cells. This makes it a promising agent for cancer therapy. Here, we present two different ways of covalently grafting TRAIL onto maghemite nanoparticles (NPs): (a) by using carboxylic acid groups of the protein to graft it onto maghemite NPs previously functionalized with amino groups, and (b) by using the amino functions of the protein to graft it onto NPs functionalized with carboxylic acid groups. The two resulting nanovectors, NH-TRAIL@NPs-CO and CO-TRAIL@NPs-NH, were thoroughly characterized. Biological studies performed on human breast and lung carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231 and H1703 cell lines) established these nanovectors are potential agents for cancer therapy. The pro-apoptotic effect is somewhat greater for CO-TRAIL@NPs-NH than NH-TRAIL@NPs-CO, as evidenced by viability studies and apoptosis analysis. A computational study indicated that regardless of whether TRAIL is attached to NPs through an acid or an amino group, DR4 recognition is not affected in either case."

Two popular immunotherapeutic approaches involve chimeric antigen receptor-T cells (CAR-T) and bispecific antibodies (BsAb). Briefly mentioned in this review as well is the mRNA vaccine technology recently popularized by the COVID-19 vaccine. These forms of immunotherapy can highly select for the tumor target of interest to generate specific tumor lysis. Along with improvements in CAR-T, bispecific antibody engineering, and therapeutic administration, much research has been done on novel molecular targets that can especially be useful for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) immunotherapy. Combining emerging immunotherapeutics with tumor marker discovery sets the stage for highly targeted immunotherapy to be the future of cancer treatments. This review highlights the principles of CAR-T and BsAb therapy, improvements in CAR and BsAb engineering, and recently identified human breast cancer markers in the context of in vitro or in vivo CAR-T or BsAb treatment."

Disseminated dormant cancer cells (DDCCs) lie below the radar before waking up years, or even decades, after the removal of the primary tumor. This implies that they are able to survive in a latent state in a foreign environment for an extended period of time supported by intrinsic and extrinsic factors still to be elucidated. (2) Methods: we employed a coculture of DDCCs with lung epithelial cells together with RNA sequencing analysis to understand the overlap in gene transcription between in vivo and cocultured DDCCs. (3) Results: we found a significant overlap between the processes activated in DDCCs from lungs and in the coculture, as well as in alveolar type I cells in vivo and in coculture. We identified the transcription factor EB (TFEB)-lysosomal axis as a relevant process activated in DDCCs upon dissemination to the lung and confirmed the results in our lung coculture. Interestingly, breast cancer patients with a higher expression of TFEB targets show increased likelihood of developing relapses. (4) Conclusions: we propose that lysosomal accumulation following TFEB activation is an important feature of breast cancer DDCCs that might be exploited for future therapeutic interventions."

More than 300 germline variants have been characterized. The detection of novel variants is important to understand the mechanisms of pathophysiology. We identified a novel pathogenic germline variant using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a proband patient. The variant is a complex rearrangement (c.422+1123_532-577 del ins 423-1933_423-1687 inv) that generates a complete deletion of exon 5 of the APC gene. To study the variant in other family members, we designed an endpoint PCR method followed by Sanger sequencing. The variant was identified in the proband patient's mother, one daughter, her brother, two cousins, a niece, and a second nephew. In patients where the variant was identified, we found atypical clinical symptoms, including mandibular, ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. Genetic counseling and cancer prevention strategies were provided for the family. According to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines, this novel variant is considered a PVS1 variant (very strong evidence of pathogenicity), and it can be useful in association with clinical data for early surveillance and suitable treatment."

In a diet-induced obese mouse model, obesity enhanced lung metastasis in both the presence and absence of primary mammary tumors and increased recruitment of myeloid lineage cells into the lungs. In the absence of tumors, obese mice demonstrated increased numbers of myeloid lineage cells and elevated collagen fibers within the lung stroma, reminiscent of premetastatic niches formed by primary tumors. Lung stromal cells isolated from obese tumor-naive mice showed increased proliferation, contractility, and expression of extracellular matrix, inflammatory markers and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta1). Conditioned media from lung stromal cells from obese mice promoted myeloid lineage cell migration in vitro in response to colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2) expression and enhanced invasion of tumor cells. Together, these results suggest that prior to tumor formation, obesity alters the lung microenvironment, creating niches conducive to metastatic growth."

These molecules exhibit great regulatory capacity and may act at different levels of gene expression regulation. Despite this regulatory versatility, the biology of these molecules is still poorly understood. Computational approaches are being increasingly used to elucidate biological mechanisms in which these lncRNAs may be involved. Co-expression networks can serve as great allies in elucidating the possible regulatory contexts in which these molecules are involved. Herein, we propose the use of the pipeline deposited in the RTN package to build lncRNAs co-expression networks using TCGA breast cancer (BC) cohort data. Worldwide, BC is the most common cancer in women and has great molecular heterogeneity. We identified an enriched co-expression network for the validation of relevant cell processes in the context of BC, including LINC00504. This lncRNA has increased expression in luminal subtype A samples, and is associated with prognosis in basal-like subtype. Silencing this lncRNA in luminal A cell lines resulted in decreased cell viability and colony formation. These results highlight the relevance of the proposed method for the identification of lncRNAs in specific biological contexts."
