However, it is not easy to estimate the temperature rise because the SDR shows different values depending on the reconstruction filter used. The resolution characteristic of a computed tomography (CT) image depends on a modulation transfer function (MTF) defined by the reconstruction filter. Differences in MTF induce unstable SDRs. The purpose of this study was both to standardize SDR by developing a method to correct the MTF and to enable effective patient screening prior to TcMRgFUS treatment and more accurate predictions of focal temperature. METHODS: CT images of a skull phantom and five subjects were obtained using eight different reconstruction filters. A frequency filter (FF) was calculated using the MTF of each reconstruction filter, and the validity of SDR standardization was evaluated by comparing the variation in SDR before and after FF correction. Subsequently, FF processing was similarly performed using the CT images of 18 patients who had undergone TcMRgFUS, and statistical analyses were performed comparing the relationship between the SDRs before and after correction and the maximum temperature in the target during TcMRgFUS treatment. RESULTS: The FF was calculated for each reconstruction filter based on one manufacturer's BONE filter. In the CT images of the skull phantom, the SDR before FF correction with five of the other seven reconstruction filters was significantly smaller than that with the BONE filter (p < 0.01). After FF correction, however, a significant difference was recognized under only one condition. In the CT images of the five subjects, variation of the SDR due to imaging conditions was significantly improved after the FF correction. In 18 cases treated with TcMRgFUS, there was no correlation between SDR before FF correction and maximum temperature (rs = 0.31, p > 0.05); however, a strong positive correlation was observed after FF correction (rs = 0.71, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: After FF correction, the difference in SDR due to the reconstruction filter used is smaller, and the correlation with temperature is stronger. Therefore, the SDR can be standardized by applying the FF, and the maximum temperature during treatment may be predicted more accurately."

DESIGN: A search strategy in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases was performed. Quality assessment was carried out through the SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Out of the 1147 potentially relevant records, 25 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were performed in rats, and ovariectomy (OVX) was the most frequent osteoporosis induction method. Histomorphometry, micro-computed tomography (microCT), and immunohistochemistry were the main bone repair evaluation methods. Most of the included studies (88 %) presented negative impacts of osteoporosis on the alveolar socket repair. Only three studies (12 %) showed no statistical differences among groups. Overall, most of the quality assessment categories presented a high percentage of unclear risk of bias due to insufficient information in the studies. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that an osteoporotic phenotype seems to impair alveolar socket repair after tooth extraction. However, there is still a lack of information and standardization. Therefore, further studies should consider the proposed methodological aspects regarding animal characteristics, OVX associated with a low calcium diet, waiting 8 weeks to osteoporosis induction, maxillary molars as the best option for tooth extraction, confirming and reporting OVX and osteoporosis success, and an appropriate method of repair analysis."

However, as waveguides, human long bones such as the tibia are complex in terms of their material behavior and their geometric features. They exhibit anisotropic elasticity and internal damping. For the first time, wave propagation is modelled in the irregular hollow tibial cross-section, which varies along its long axis. Semi-analytical, frequency domain, and time domain finite element analyses providing complimentary information about long-range wave propagation characteristics in such a waveguide are applied to the mid-diaphyseal region of a human tibia. Simulating the guided waves generated by a contact transducer, the signals received in axial transmission indicate the consistent presence of low phase velocity non-dispersive propagating modes. The guided waves capable of traveling long distances have strong potential for diagnosis of fracture healing."

The effect of location and size of heterogeneity on dose distribution was also evaluated. Neutron and photon dose rate distributions were determined in a water phantom in presence of air, lung, soft tissue and bone heterogeneities using MCNPX code. To benchmark the Monte Carlo simulation of the (252)Cf source, air kerma strength(SKN), dose rate constant (N) and radial dose function (gN(r)) were calculated and compared with previously reported data. Results showed a considerable reduction of neutron dose rate (up to 66%) inside heterogeneities, especially in air and bone heterogeneities, while the reduction of total photon dose rate was found less significant (up to 10%). In the presence of a heterogeneity, dose rate, fluence and energy spectrum were significantly different with respect to the homogenous phantom. The contribution of photon dose to the total dose in the presence of air and bone was dominant, compared to the neutron dose, whereas this photon contribution was reduced after passing the heterogeneity. As the bone heterogeneity size was increased from 1 x 1 x 1 cm(3) to 1 x 3 x 1 cm(3), the total dose and neutron energy fluence decreased of about 50% and 70%, respectively."

Depending on the compressed structure, it is categorized into neurological, arterial and venous TOS. SAPHO syndrome (synovitis-acne-pustulosis-hyperostosis-osteitis syndrome) is a rare chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. With its typical involvement of sternoclavicular joint and clavicle, complication due to hyperostosis in this region, leading to thrombosis of the subclavian vein have been reported in some cases of SAPHO syndrome. Between 2015 and 2019 488 patients, suffering from neurological, vascular or combined TOS presented at our department. Depending on clinical and diagnostic results surgical therapy was performed in 175 cases via the transaxillary approach, including complete first rib and/or cervical rib resection, neurolysis of plexus brachialis, thoracic sympathectomy and vascular reconstruction if indicated (Curuk, 2020). During this period, only one single patient presented with SAPHO syndrome with thrombosis of the subclavian vein and neurovascular TOS. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 50-year-old female patient, in line with the SCARE 2020 criteria (Agha et al., 2020 [12]) suffering from extremely rare combination of neurovascular TOS and SAPHO syndrome with thrombosis of the left subclavian vein due to hyperostosis of the left clavicle. CONCLUSION: Progressive bone changes associated with SAPHO syndrome can lead to narrowing of the thoracic outlet. Pharmacological therapies to avoid the progression of the hyperostosis of the costoclavicular joint and the clavicle do currently not exist. First rib resection is a therapeutic option to widen the space in the upper thoracic region. Surely, it is a rare condition and more long-term follow-up data are required."

To overcome these difficulties, new therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Yet, implementing novel drugs for clinical use is a time-consuming, laborious, costly and high-risk process. Therefore, we applied a drug-repositioning strategy by screening drug libraries, comprised of >4000 compounds that are mostly FDA-approved, in a high-throughput format on primary MLL-rearranged AML cells. Here we identified pyrvinium pamoate (pyrvinium) as a novel candidate drug effective against MLL-rearranged AML, eliminating all cell viability at <1000nM. Additional screening of identified drug hits on non-leukemic bone marrow samples, resulted in a decrease in cell viability of approximately 50% at 1000nM pyrvinium, suggesting a therapeutic window for targeting leukemic cells specifically. Validation of pyrvinium on an extensive panel of AML cell lines and primary AML samples showed comparable viabilities as the drug screen data, with pyrvinium achieving IC50 values of <80nM in these samples. Remarkably, pyrvinium also induced cell toxicity in primary MLL-AF10(+) AML cells, an MLL-rearrangement associated with a poor outcome. While pyrvinium is able to inhibit the Wnt pathway in other diseases, this unlikely explains the efficacy we observed as beta-catenin was not expressed in the AML cells tested. Rather, we show that pyrvinium co-localized with the mitochondrial stain in cells, and hence may act by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. Overall, this study shows that pyrvinium is highly effective against MLL-rearranged AML in vitro, and therefore represents a novel potential candidate for further studies in MLL-rearranged AML."

The main focus of the scaffold is to provide mechanical support to newly formed blood vessels and cells that will colonize the grafted site, achiving bone regenertation. In this regards, the aim of this study was to characterize the anatomy, structular, surface morphologycal, chemical composition, and nanomechanical properties of ostrich and equine trabecular bone. Ostrich and equine specimens were obtained from a local abattoir and bone was obtained by blunt dissection, n = 5. Tissue bone anatomy and trabecular structure were measured using Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Energy dispersion spectrometry of X-ray (EDS) were used to examine surface morphology and chemical composition of the trabecular ostrich and equine bone. Mechanical behavior was analysted by nanoindentation. Equine specimens were examined as control. CAT results suggest that in terms of anthropometry, ostrich tarsometatarsus bone is more suitable due to its length is 432.56 +/- 3.12 mm vs. the highest human bone structures reported, which femur length is 533.66 +/- 18.81 mm. Besides, the low radiodensity in the Hounsfield scale exhibits equine trabecular bone more brittle (Av = 1538.4 +/- 0.9) than ostrich trabecular bone (Av = 462.1 +/- 1.5). EDS showed a slight variation of the element Calcium (Ca(2+)) ranging from 20% to 25.5% wt in equine bone; the Ca(2+) content variation is consistent with the ring-shaped morphology, while in ostrich bone the chemical composition is homogeneous. The elastic modulus, nanohardness (E = 5.3 +/- 0.7 GPa, H = 220 +/- 10 MPa) and average roughness (Ra = 207 nm) are similar to the human trabecular bone which could reduce the stress shielding, all of these findings suggest that ostrich bone can be promising for native tissue scaffolds for mechanically demanding applications. This research makes innovative contributions to science and provides a framework, which will allow us to address future biomedical tests, and rapidly identify promising organic and sustainable waste for tissue scaffold."

Medline database was searched from 2003 to 2019 for studies with available nephrectomy data. RESULTS: We identified 609 studies, subsequently restricted to 57 randomized phase II/III clinical trials and 6 EAPs. Overall, 33196 patients with mRCC were included, among whom 28700 (86.4%) underwent nephrectomy.The trends over time of nephrectomy occurrence remained substantially stable from 2003 to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis highlighted that data from RCTs and EAPs driving the clinical practice originate from nephrectomized patient populations.

Our purpose was to report prosthesis survival, complications, and outcomes of RSA in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at minimum 5-year follow-up. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study including 65 consecutive primary RSAs performed in 59 patients with RA between 1991 and 2010. We excluded rheumatoid patients with previous failed anatomic shoulder arthroplasty. Age at surgery averaged 69 years (range, 46-86 years). A structural bone grafting was performed in 18 cases (45%), using the humeral head in 15 cases (BIO-RSA technique), the iliac crest in 2 cases (Norris technique), and an allograft in 1 case. The mean follow-up was 92 months (range, 60-147 months) or until revision surgery. RESULTS: Revision-free survivorship, using Kaplan-Meyer curves, was 96% at 7 years. Two patients were revised for infections, with associated glenoid loosening in 1 case. No humeral loosening was recorded. The mean adjusted Constant score improved from 36 +/-23% preoperatively to 90 +/-26% postoperatively, and mean SSV improved from 21 +/-13% to 85 +/-12%, respectively (p<0.001). Active anterior elevation increased from 65 degrees +/-43 to 132 degrees +/-27, active external rotation increased from 10 degrees +/-26 to 22 degrees +/-27, and internal rotation improved from buttocks to waist (p<0.001). Stable fixation of the baseplate was achieved in all cases (including the 6 patients with ""end stage"" RA) and we did not observe bone graft non-union or resorption. Preoperative radiologic pattern (centered, ascending, or destructive), presence of acromial fractures or tilt (4 cases, 10%), and scapular notching (55%) on final radiographs were not found to influence outcomes or complication rate. Patients with absent/atrophied teres minor had lower functional results. Overall, 95% of the patients were satisfied with the procedure. CONCLUSION: RSA is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of RA patients, with a low risk of complications and low rate of revision, regardless of the radiological presentation and stage of the disease. Rheumatoid patients undergoing primary RSA, with or without or glenoid bone grafting, can expect a revision-free survival rate of 96% at 7-year follow-up. RSA offers the benefits of solving two key problems encountered in rheumatoid shoulders: glenoid bone destruction and rotator cuff deficiency."

In this study, we created a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targeted the DHYAVMISK peptide, aimed to determine whether it could inhibit the growth of P. gingivalis in vitro, and block its induction of experimental periodontitis and subsequent bone loss. Peptide DGFPG-DHYAVMISK conjugated to KLH (DK-KLH) was synthetic, and injected subcutaneously into BALB/c mice to generate specific mAbs with the hybridoma technique. We isolated mAb 1H11, which showed specific binding to DK. When we incubated these mAbs with P. gingivalis in vitro for 18h, bacterial growth was significantly lower in cultures treated with mAb 1H11 compared to those treated with control (PBS; P<0.05). Next, we induced experimental periodontitis in mouse models with a silk ligature and a P. gingivalis infection. When we injected the mAbs into the gingival sulcus, the group treated with mAb 1H11 displayed a reduction in bone loss compared to the other treatment groups. Thus, mAb 1H11 might provide protection against a P. gingivalis infection. Accordingly, this antibody could serve as a candidate therapy for periodontitis or other infections caused by P. gingivalis."

BMPs activate intracellular effectors via C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad1, 5 and 9, which relay the signaling by forming a complex with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus for transcriptional activation. Smad6 inhibits BMP signaling through diverse mechanisms operative at the membrane, cytosolic and nuclear levels. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of Smad6 functional diversity remain unclear. Here, using biochemical approach and cell differentiation systems, we report a cytosolic mechanism of action for Smad6 that requires arginine methylation at R81 and functions through association with Smad1 and interference with the formation of Smad1/Smad4 complexes. By mutating the methylated arginine residue, R81, and by silencing expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), we show that PRMT1 catalyzes R81 methylation of Smad6 upon BMP treatment; R81 methylation subsequently facilitates Smad6 interaction with the phosphorylated active Smad1; and R81 methylation facilitates Smad6-mediated interruption of Smad1/Smad4 complex formation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, Smad6 wild type but not the methylation-deficient R81A mutant inhibited BMP-responsive transcription, attenuated BMP-mediated osteogenic differentiation and antagonized BMP-mediated inhibition of cell invasion. Taken together our results suggest that R81 methylation plays an essential role in Smad6-mediated inhibition of BMP responses."

The local curvature of an evolving tissue induces tissue crowding or spreading, which leads to differential tissue growth rates, and to changes in cellular tension, which can influence cell behaviour. Here, we investigate how directed cell motion interacts with curvature control in evolving biological tissues. Directed cell motion is involved in the generation of angled tissue growth and anisotropic tissue material properties, such as tissue fibre orientation. We develop a new cell-based mathematical model of tissue growth that includes both curvature control and cell guidance mechanisms to investigate their interplay. The model is based on conservation principles applied to the density of tissue synthesising cells at or near the tissue's moving boundary. The resulting mathematical model is a partial differential equation for cell density on a moving boundary, which is solved numerically using a hybrid front-tracking method called the cell-based particle method. The inclusion of directed cell motion allows us to model new types of biological growth, where tangential cell motion is important for the evolution of the interface, or for the generation of anisotropic tissue properties. We illustrate such situations by applying the model to simulate both the resorption and infilling components of the bone remodelling process,provide user-friendly MATLAB code to implement the algorithms."

The pathogenesis of RA involves the formation of a hyperplastic synovial tissue, termed pannus, which invades the local bone and causes osseous erosion. Here we describe a case of rapid onset quadriparesis due to spinal cord compression at C5-C6 secondary to vertebral subluxation and mass effect from a large inflammatory pannus in the subaxial spine. Surgical decompression and resection of the subaxial pannus was performed, and the patient regained strength in all extremities. Histopathologic evaluation of the resected tissue confirmed the diagnosis of pannus over other more common epidural masses. Pannus formation commonly occurs in the peri-odontoid region, however its presentation as a large soft tissue mass in the subaxial spine is not described in the current literature. Therefore, pannus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of epidural masses in the spine of RA patients. We use this case to discuss the pathology and radiological findings relevant to rheumatoid pannus formation in the subaxial cervical spine, as well as emphasize the importance of treatment in the context to severe degenerative disease."

CONCLUSION: Our study provides relevant clinical evidence on the performance and safety of CUSTOMBONE prosthesis in cranial procedures. Complications that are difficulty incompressible mainly occur during the first 6 months, but can appear at a later stage (> 1 year). Thus assiduous, regular and long-term surveillances are necessary."

Although the association between osteitis and poor surgical outcomes is well-known in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), BMPs have not been fully investigated as potential biomarkers for the prognosis of CRS. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the role of BMPs in osteitis in CRS with nasal polyp (NP) (CRSwNP) patients, as well as associations between BMPs and inflammatory markers in sinonasal tissues from CRSwNP patients. METHODS: We investigated the expression of 6 BMPs (BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-9, and BMP-10) and their cellular origins in NPs of human subjects using immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of NP tissues. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to identify associations between BMPs and inflammatory markers. Air-liquid interface (ALI) cell culture of human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) was performed to evaluate the induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by BMPs. RESULTS: Of the 6 BMPs studied, BMP-2 and BMP-7 were associated with refractoriness. Only BMP-2 concentrations were higher in patients with severe osteitis and advanced disease extent based on computed tomography findings. Eosinophils and some macrophages were identified as cellular sources of BMP-2 in immunofluorescence analysis. An in vitro experiment revealed that BMP-2 induced EMT in ALI-cultured hNECs, particularly in a Th2 milieu. CONCLUSION: BMP-2 could reflect the pathophysiology of mucosa and bone remodeling, and may be a novel biomarker for refractory CRSwNP."

Mouse models of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) expressing JAK2-V617F (VF) or a JAK2 exon 12 mutation (E12) displayed increased frequencies and percentages of the CD41hi versusCD41lo HSCs compared to wildtype controls. An increase in CD41hi HSCs that correlated with JAK2-V617F mutant allele burden was also found in bone marrow from MPN patients. CD41hi HSCs produced higher numbers of Mk-colonies HSC in single cell cultures in vitro, but showed reduced long-term reconstitution potential compared to CD41lo HSCs in competitive transplantations in vivo. RNA expression profiling showed upregulated cell cycle, Myc, and oxidative phosphorylation gene signatures in CD41hi HSCs, while CD41lo HSCs showed higher gene expression of interferon, JAK/STAT and TNFalpha/NFkB signaling pathways. Higher cell cycle activity and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species were confirmed in CD41hi HSCs by flow cytometry. Expression of Epcr, a marker for quiescent HSCs inversely correlated with expression of CD41 in mice, but did not show such reciprocal expression pattern in MPN patients. Treatment with interferon-alpha further increased the frequency and percentage of CD41hi HSCs and reduced the numbers of JAK2-V617F positive HSCs in mice and patients with MPN. The shift towards the CD41hi subset of HSCs by interferon-alpha provides a possible mechanism of how interferon-alpha preferentially targets the JAK2 mutant clone."

Although the activity of CD8+ T lymphocytes is essential to eliminate these pathogens, earlier studies have shown significant participation of macrophages at the beginning of the infection. Macrophages and other innate immunity cells play a critical role in activating the acquired immunity. After programmed cell death, the cell fragments or apoptotic bodies are cleared by phagocytic cells, a phenomenon known as efferocytosis. This process has been recognized as a way of evading immunity by intracellular pathogens. The present study evaluated the impact of efferocytosis of apoptotic cells either infected or not on macrophages and subsequently challenged with Encephalitozoon cuniculi microsporidia. Macrophages were obtained from the bone marrow monocytes from C57BL mice, pre-incubated with apoptotic Jurkat cells (ACs), and were further challenged with E. cuniculi spores. The same procedures were performed using the previously infected Jurkat cells (IACs) and challenged with E. cuniculi spores before macrophage pre-incubation. The average number of spores internalized by macrophages in phagocytosis was counted. Macrophage expression of CD40, CD206, CD80, CD86, and MHCII, as well as the cytokines released in the culture supernatants, was measured by flow cytometry. The ultrastructural study was performed to analyze the multiplication types of pathogens. Macrophages pre-incubated with ACs and challenged with E. cuniculi showed a higher percentage of phagocytosis and an average number of internalized spores. Moreover, the presence of stages of multiplication of the pathogen inside the macrophages, particularly after efferocytosis of infected apoptotic bodies, was observed. In addition, pre-incubation with ACs or IACs and/or challenge with the pathogen decreased the viability of macrophages, reflected as high percentages of apoptosis. The marked expression of CD206 and the release of large amounts of IL-10 and IL-6 indicated the polarization of macrophages to an M2 profile, compatible with efferocytosis and favorable for pathogen development. We concluded that the pathogen favored efferocytosis and polarized the macrophages to an M2 profile, allowing the survival and multiplication of E. cuniculi inside the macrophages and explaining the possibility of macrophages acting as Trojan horses in microsporidiosis."
